Society A paper coauthored by JQI Fellow Ian Spielman in 2011 has been highlighted by the journal Physical Review A as part of its 50th anniversary of only 26 that the journal plans to highlight in its anniversary milestones collection The collection comprises papers published in the journal that have made important contributions to atomic molecular and optical physics and quantum information by announcing significant discoveries or by initiating new areas of Highlighting these notable papers is part of the American Physical Society s celebration of the splitting of the journal Physical Review into four journals Physical Review that each cover different specialized physics content In Spielman s paper which was also highlighted by Google Scholar Metrics in 2014 he and his colleagues proposed an experimental setup to create quantum interactions called Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling for an atomic condensate coupling is an interaction where the properties of attribute of quantum objects related to rotation and momentum become tied together The phenomenon helps stabilize the states against quantum disturbances and plays an important role in materials like topological insulators that are of theoretical and technological interest The paper describes how experiments can create the desired coupling for electrically neutral rubidium atoms by using lasers and it also provides an intuitive visual framework for understanding such experiments as an alternative to the prior mathematical description that researchers were using What I think this proposal really did is change the language that we used to think about engineering coupled systems says Spielman This paper provides a construction that you can do on the fly in your head to know about what going to happen in an In the proposal several lasers are set up so that they interact with the atoms simultaneously to create the appropriate quantum state with the desired coupling The paper presented the physics in the experiments in terms of how the photons that make up the lasers contribute momentum to the atoms According to Xiangyu Yin the associate editor of Physical Review A Spielman s paper inspired several successful experimental realizations of coupled neutral atoms in two dimensions paving the way for exploring exotic quantum phases in a new In addition to experiments by others Spielman s own research group at JQI has built on this work and he says that he hopes that similar experiments with atoms other than rubidium will open opportunities to explore even more new physics Reference
