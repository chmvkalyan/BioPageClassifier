to Advance Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon February 26 2019 Gift to Advance Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon 10 million commitment will endow department headship support construction of new building Media Inquiries Jason Maderer Marketing Communications maderer through An entrepreneurial idea to expand training for careers hatched on a working ranch in Montana and in Carnegie Mellon University advanced manufacturing laboratories has sparked a 10 million gift to support mechanical engineering at the and alumnus David Coulter and his wife Susan Coulter have made the transformational commitment that will endow the headship for the Department of Mechanical Engineering as well as support the construction of a new Scaife Hall which will house the department The endowment to support the department head will provide critical funds for emerging priorities in mechanical engineering and is the first endowed headship announced in the college The department is ranked in the top 10 in the nation by News World Report which also places the College of Engineering at No 6 David Coulter talks about his collaboration with the NextManufacturing Center and his support of both the Tepper School of Business and Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon David and Susan have been outstanding university citizens for decades CMU President Farnam Jahanian said Their latest act of generosity that will benefit the Carnegie Mellon community promises to advance one of our leading programs one that is driving manufacturing innovations for our modern world The inspiration for the gift began on the Coulters ranch outside of Bozeman Montana where David Coulter saw the need for workers with skills to operate and maintain modern machinery related to the local mining and agriculture economy Following a conversation with Carnegie Mellon Provost Jim Garrett then dean of the College of Engineering he began working with the NextManufacturing Center part of the college advanced manufacturing initiative which includes additive manufacturing or 3D printing as it is commonly known There the center leadership including Sandra DeVincent Wolf Jack Beuth and Anthony Rollett helped Coulter evolve his initial vision of vocational training into an expansive idea that combines traditional skill development with new technology such as additive manufacturing A facility where locals will be able to train for manufacturing careers at the leading edge of the new economy is now under construction in positive collaboration between the Tepper School of Business alumnus and mechanical engineering faculty became the foundation for the Coulters generous gift At Carnegie Mellon we often speak about how our strengths in deep disciplinary knowledge truly take flight when we collaborate across disciplines Coulter said I feel like we doing that with this project and I see our involvement as an alumni prototype for these projects We proud to support both the Tepper School of Business as well as the College of Engineering and am excited to see what the Mechanical Engineering Department will achieve From left Farnam Jahanian Susan Coulter David Coulter and James Rohr at the Coulter Welcome Coulters commitment to a new Scaife Hall follows a lead grant from the Allegheny Foundation in October When complete the new building will more than double the size of the existing building and will include expanded labs modern flexible classrooms and spaces that facilitate formal and informal collaborations Following demolition of the current building the 75 million facility will be constructed on an expanded footprint at the same location on Frew Street near Flagstaff Hill on the CMU campus Mechanical Engineering is a leader in emerging fields such as soft robotics and advanced batteries We need facilities in the department to support the exceptional work of our faculty and students said Allen Robinson department head and professor We are so grateful for David and Susan extraordinary generosity which will impact the department for decades to come Robinson who will become the first Coulter Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering will continue to hold the Raymond J Lane Distinguished Professorship in Mechanical Coulters past CMU support includes a 5 million contribution to the recently completed first building on the David A Tepper Quadrangle The David and Susan Coulter Welcome Center housed in the Tepper Quad building is the new front door to campus a destination for all visitors including prospective students and their 1971 alumnus of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration now the Tepper School of Business David Coulter is a special limited partner with Warburg Pincus LLC in New York City Previously he was vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase and and chairman and CEO of Bank of America Corp In 2018 he was honored with the Tepper School Alumni Lifetime Achievement Award The NextManufacturing Center is one of the world leading research centers for additive manufacturing commonly known as 3D printing The center leverages knowledge from across disciplines to develop an entirely new approach to additive manufacturing design optimization materials selection and characterization process parameter mapping software development final part inspection and qualification Jack Beuth David Coulter Anthony Rollett and Sandra DeVincent Wolf are working together to evolve Coulter vision of vocational training into an expansive idea that combines traditional skill development with new technology through
