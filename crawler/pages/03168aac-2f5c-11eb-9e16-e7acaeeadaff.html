materials can help organizations use SEI Software Assurance Curricula in academic programs or workforce development efforts Publisher Software Engineering Institute Abstract This collection of supplementary materials and references is intended to help organizations use SEI Software Assurance Curricula in academic settings or workforce development efforts Workforce Development for Software Assurance The Roadmap to Software Assurance Competency can help your organization initiate the use of software assurance competencies The SEI developed the Software Assurance Competency Model to create a foundation for assessing and advancing the capability of software assurance professionals Endorsed by IEEE Computer Society this model helps organizations and individuals determine their SwA competency across a range of knowledge areas and units It provides a span of competency levels 1 through 5 as well as a decomposition into individual competencies based on knowledge and skills It is a framework that an organization can adapt to its particular domain culture or structure On July 5 2014 the Software and Systems Engineering Committee of the IEEE Computer Society Professional Activities Board PAB endorsed the SEI Software Assurance Competency Model as being both appropriate for software assurance roles and consistent with A Framework for PAB Competency Models Supplementary Materials These are donated materials that could supplement a variety of software assurance courses at various academic levels or in workforce development SQUARE Instructional Materials Software
