in creating a welcoming and supportive environment and cultivating a sense of belonging The result is good for business and morale said Haritos Tsamitis who is a program on the local host committee along with Bobbie Stempfley director of the CERT Division at CMU Software Engineering Institute Stempfley said in addition to a low number of women who begin careers in cybersecurity another problem is that many of them leave the field in the middle of their careers That often the point when many women feel their voices are no longer being heard Stempfley said Nearly every narrative in security is male the guy in the hoodie metaphors to sports and warfare It a very stereotyped career We need to make improvements to ensure women feel more welcome and that their perspectives and expertise are considered as much as those from the majority The event goal is to broaden participation in the cybersecurity field by recruiting retaining and advancing females in the field of cybersecurity There are some unfilled cybersecurity jobs nationwide according to and various projections estimate the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs may double by 2021 At the same time women currently comprise only 11 to 14 percent of the cybersecurity workforce CMU has made a commitment to purposefully seek out outstanding women and support them during their studies through the concerted and coordinated efforts of university leaders faculty advocates and role models staff and fellow students At CMU women make up about 50 percent of the class in Carnegie Mellon s School of Computer Science and 43 percent in the College of Engineering which represent two to three times the national average for those fields Security and privacy research crosses many disciplines at the university including those
