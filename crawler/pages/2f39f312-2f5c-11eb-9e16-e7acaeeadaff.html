Point of View We believe everyone has the capacity to be creative Putting design to work We build on methods from across the field of design to create learning experiences that help people unlock their creative potential and apply it to the can be applied to all kinds of problems But just like humans problems are often messy and need to be tackled with some serious creative thinking That s where our approach comes in Adding the tools and methods to a person skill set often results in a striking transformation Newfound creative confidence changes how people think about themselves and their ability to have impact in the world How we do it Unleashing Creativity Here s what that looks like at the Our way of working Radical collaboration To inspire creative thinking we bring together students faculty and practitioners from all disciplines perspectives and we say radical we mean it Different points of view are key in pushing students to advance their own design practice Our methods become a shared language for groups to navigate the ups and downs of messy projects Students want to make real impact in the world We think they can start immediately Our classes challenge them to tackle problems that are happening right now not the ones from a textbook page We work with partners from corporate and government organizations to develop projects that address problems Like in life there is no single right answer in a class The problems are complex and ambiguous The solutions are uncertain and unclear We give students ample opportunities to experiment take creative risks and fail It great preparation for problem it is problem culture The people who are here want to be here No student or faculty member at Stanford is required to participate Use our tools Explore Our Resources Everyone is Creative We believe We aim to activelyconfront and challenge the mindset that design can only be used by a privileged few The mission is to help people unlock their creative abilities and apply them to the world It reflects our foundational belief that design should be accessible to all and that everyone is creative We believe design can help create the world we wish for Design can activate us as creators and change the way we see ourselves and others Design is filled with optimism hope and the joy that comes from making things change by making things real We believe that diversity leads to better design and opens up a greater range of creative possibilities The nature of design affords people the opportunity and privilege to shape the world that This is power In a just world that power is shared prioritizing the voices and ideas of people most impacted by the intended and unintended effects of new designs We aim to actively confront and challenge the mindset that design can only be used by a privileged few Given our ideals we have work to do Find out more About us 8 core abilities Navigate AmbiguityThis is the ability to recognize and persist in the discomfort of not knowing and develop tactics to overcome ambiguity when is loaded with uncertainty As a result it involves being present in the moment problems and finding patterns in information Ambiguity can arise in many places within a project a process or within oneself It s important to put students in ambiguous situations and give them tactics to emerge from from Others People and Contexts This means empathizing with and embracing diverse viewpoints testing new ideas with others and observing and learning from unfamiliar a design project it s important to recognize and take the opportunity to learn from end users and other stakeholders and team members There is a sensitivity to others that develops with this InformationThis is the ability to make sense of information and find insight and opportunity comes from multiple places and has many different forms both qualitative and quantitative This ability requires skills in developing frameworks maps and abductive thinking Synthesis is hard for new students It takes time and is interdependent with navigating RapidlyThis ability is about being able to quickly generate ideas whether written drawn or order to rapidly experiment you must be able to relax your mind and reach a mode of acceptance This will eliminate the natural tendency to block ideas that seem off or unfeasible Then let your doing lead your thinking and lead with your hands This ability pairs naturally with Learn From Others In many instances you are experimenting by both generating a flood of new concepts at low resolution brainstorming and testing some of those concepts with potential Between Concrete and AbstractThis ability involves understanding stakeholders and purpose in order to define the product or service s is connected When students are building out a new concept a product service or experience they need to be able to nest the concept within the larger ecosystem that relates to it We have Ray and Charles Eames to thank for helping us set the scene for this ability It involves abstraction to define meaning goals and principles as well as precision to define details and and Craft IntentionallyThis ability is about thoughtful construction showing work at the most appropriate level of resolution for the audience and feedback are many of design each with their own set of tools and techniques This ability requires a sensitivity to the tools needed to create meaningful work in your domain UX designers have a specific set of tools to create digital interfaces Architects have an arsenal of particular techniques to bring new structures into the world Every discipline immunology macroeconomics K12 education whatever it may be has its own building methods and in every case the details DeliberatelyThis is the ability to form capture and relate stories ideas concepts reflections and learnings to the appropriate happens in a variety of contexts It may include reflecting on your performance to a project team or crafting a video to show your product to a potential investor As we practice experiential learning at the communication and storytelling are your Design WorkThis meta ability is about recognizing a project as a design problem and then deciding on the people tools techniques and processes needed to tackle ability develops with practice We see it emerge in our more experienced students It requires using intuition adapting old tools to new contexts and developing original techniques to meet the challenge at hand Our impact Our work in the world The s impact can be seen in a variety of ways
