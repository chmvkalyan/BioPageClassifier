finds that hot streaks in sports are no illusion Economists should take 25 Edmund Andrews Email Red Sox left fielder Jonny Gomes kisses his bat during a team workout at Fenway Park 2013 USA Today Sports photo by Greg Cooper Sports fans rejoice You may have been right all along about hot streaks They are a figment of your imagination Contradicting academic studies dating back 30 years researchers at Stanford Berkeley and Harvard are now finding that a hot hand in basketball or baseball is not a statistical illusion In fact hot streaks can help predict a player likelihood of getting another hit or sinking another basket Perhaps surprisingly this has implications for a raging debate in finance about the rationality or lack of it in markets But first about the sports Athletes coaches and sports fans overwhelmingly believe in the hot hand the idea that a player whose shooting percentage is higher than normal is likely to keep shooting better than normal at least for a while Indeed coaches often rotate players in and out of play based on a sense of who has turned hot or cold Academic scholars thought they had debunked this idea years ago Starting with a famous 1985 study of basketball shooting experts have argued in dozens of papers that the hot hand is nothing more than statistical noise Athletes may seem to go on hot streaks goes the argument but these are just random fluctuations without predictive value People who believe in hot hands the skeptics have argued are seeing patterns that do exist Hot streaks can help predict a player likelihood of getting another hit according to new research by Professor Jeffrey Zwiebel and Brett Green PhD Associated Press photo by Mark Duncan But in a major new study of baseball data Jeffrey Zwiebel at Stanford Graduate School of Business and Brett Green at University of California Haas School of Business at Berkeley find that hot hands are real and have predictive power Why would business professors jump into a sports debate Because the fallacy has become a staple in arguments by supporters of behavioral economics to argue that individuals can be irrational For example the behaviorists have argued that investors often get lured into bad decisions by seeing patterns that are real According to the behaviorists investors make a wide range of cognitive mistakes that range from overconfidence in their own abilities to a tendency to to news That critique gained a lot of traction in the wake of the mortgage bust and the great financial crisis A 2009 paper lays out the theory and potential financial applications of the fallacy A 2012 paper argues that the fallacy explains why people pay for useless investment advice And in a brand new paper German scholars even found evidence that people who believe in the fallacy are more at risk of unemployment The fallacy has its own roots at Stanford Thomas Gilovich a graduate student in the early 1980s began comparing the widespread perception of hot streaks in basketball to the hard data Gilovich now at Cornell led a study showing that the hot hand did really exist The shooting records of the Philadelphia 76ers provided no predictive value of subsequent shots A player might be hot one minute but not the next Fans and even sports professionals they concluded were making decisions based on myopic impressions Zwiebel and Green argue that the original finding failed to account for a key issue In basketball the opposing team quickly adjusts to a hot player devoting extra coverage and forcing that player to attempt more difficult shots As a result it inevitable that a hot player shooting percentage will decline It not because the hot streak was an illusion but rather that the hot player attracted more opposition Baseball is different because pitchers and coaches have very limited ability to resources against a hitter on a hot streak Pitchers and coaches do play to a hitter particular weaknesses but they ca put more people in the hitter way To test their ideas Zwiebel and Green amassed data on 2 million Major League Baseball over 12 years They looked at 10 categories of performance from batting averages and percentages to rates For pitchers they looked at data such as the average number of hits allowed They also controlled for the fundamental ability of both pitchers and hitters in order to isolate the actual streakiness of a player performance A player most recent 25 times at bat was a significant predictor of how that player would do at his next time up good enough to justify an adaptive reaction by Zweibel professor of finance The result A player most recent 25 times at bat was a significant predictor of how that player would do at his next time up good enough to justify an adaptive reaction by coaches When a player is hot the researchers calculated his expected percentage will be 25 to 30 points higher than it would be if he just has been cold Similarly a player on a hot streak will be 30 more likely to hit a home run than if he has been on a cold streak These results are important enough to rationalize common coaching decisions and fan perceptions with respect to hot players Zwiebel and Green write in their paper Zwiebel says the earlier researchers were too quick to conclude that the belief in a hot hand was evidence of a cognitive or behavioral mistake Most likely what really at work is not so much a mistake but an equilibrium adjustment around the player similar to the kinds of equilibrium adjustments that occur in finance and economics The behavioral camp jumps too quickly to the conclusion that almost all sports fans and participants are under a dumb illusion that there are hot hands Zwiebel says They have jumped to that conclusion because it fits their story that everyone is making cognitive mistakes and that these mistakes are extraordinarily pervasive As it happens a team of Harvard researchers reached a similar conclusion in a new study of basketball The Harvard team looked at data on shots made during the National Basketball Association season But instead of looking simply at completion rates the researchers built a model for gauging the difficulty of shots They found that players who had exceeded their expectations in recent shots were likely to face tighter opposition and take more difficult shots Adjusting for the increased difficulty of the shots the researchers found that hot players were likely to continue outperforming The effect they estimated raised their chances of making a shot by to Zwiebel larger point is that behaviorists use the supposed fallacy to jump to unwarranted conclusions They see cognitive mistakes everywhere they look The problem he argues is that the misdiagnosis of a problem such as the mortgage bust can lead to the wrong remedies Investment bankers have been criticized for underestimating the risks of subprime mortgages for being irrational in their optimism But it possible that their excessive was irrational as much as it was encouraged or even subsidized by regulatory policies such as those that protected banks considered too big to fail The difference between those two diagnoses of the financial crisis leads to very different proposals for reform One can portray the financial crisis as being triggered by a bunch of mistakes or one can portray it as the consequence of risky decisions that were made based on the incentives and subsidies in the system he says I see it as more of the latter Jeffrey Zwiebel is the James Van Horne Professor of Finance at
