of 2016 Fabric Ansible Gauntlt and Chaos Monkey The Top 10 DevOps Posts of The First Six Months of 2016 July 12 2016 DevOps Blog Hasan Yasar DevOps It has been nearly a year since the DevOps blog launched its own platform In the nearly 12 months since our launch we have offered guidelines practical advice and tutorials to the number of organizations adopting DevOps up 26 percent since 2011 In the first six months of 2016 an increasing number of blog visitors were drawn to posts highlighting successful DevOps implementations at Amazon and Netflix as well as tutorials on new technologies such as Otto Fabric Ansible and Docker This post presents in descending order with 1 being the most popular the 10 most popular DevOps posts published in the first six months of 2016 10 Adding Security to Your DevOps Pipeline DevOps practitioners often omit security testing when building their DevOps pipelines because security is often linked with business units and outdated policies These characteristics conflict with the overall goal of DevOps which is to improve the software delivery process However security plays an important role in the software development lifecycle and must be addressed in all applications Incorporating security into different stages of the DevOps pipeline will not only start to automate security but will allow your security process to become traceable and easily repeatable For instance static code analysis could be done on each code commit and penetration testing could be completed as part of the deployment phase In this blog post Kiriakos Kontostathis presents two common tools that can be used during deployment that allow for automated security tests Gauntlt and OWASP Zed Attack Proxy ZAP Here is an excerpt Gauntlt is a security testing tool that incorporates existing organizational tools that are used for security testing nmap This tool is built on the Cucumber framework and provides an easy to read language that gives users the ability to write their own attacks Gauntlt also provides example attacks for most common attacks on its Github repo A Gauntlt attack file consists of primarily two sections the background and the scenarios The background section ensures that the packages needed for the attacks are installed and that developers can connect to the host that is being tested for security The scenario section is where the attacks or tests are actually performed Operational staff can have an unlimited number of scenarios but it is best practice to have a small number of them That way each attack file will not get too broad I have prepared a short walkthrough that shows how to set up to run Gauntlt tests for your web application I will be using the Gauntlt starter kit to set up the environment quickly You will need Vagrant VirtualBox and Git installed on your local machine for this demo Read the complete post 9 An Introduction to DevOps At Flickr the and website the live software platform is updated at least 10 times a day Flickr accomplishes this through an automated testing cycle that includes comprehensive unit testing and integration testing at all levels of the software stack in a realistic staging environment If the code passes it is then tagged released built and pushed into production This type of lean organization where software is delivered on a continuous basis is exactly what the agile founders envisioned when crafting their manifesto a nimble process for developing and deploying software into the hands of users while continuously integrating feedback and new requirements A key to Flickr prolific deployment is DevOps a software development concept that literally and figuratively blends development and operations staff and tools in response to the increasing need for interoperability In this blog post the first in a series Aaron Cois introduces DevOps and explores its impact from an internal perspective on our own software development practices and through the lens of its impact on the software community at large Here is an excerpt At the SEI I oversee a software engineering team that works within CERT Cyber Security Solutions CS2 Directorate Within CS2 our engineers design and implement software solutions that solve challenging problems for federal agencies law enforcement defense intelligence organizations and industry by leveraging academic research and emerging technologies The manner in which teams develop software is constantly evolving A decade ago most software development environments were siloed consisting of software developers in one silo and mainframe computers and a staff of IT professionals who maintained that mainframe in another silo The arrival of virtualization marked a technological revolution in the field of software development Before if I needed a new server for my web application I would have to order the server and wait for it to ship Then upon arrival I would have to rack the server install and provision the system and configure networking and access controls all before I could begin my real development work Read the complete post 8 Developing with Otto A First Look You will be hard pressed to find a DevOps software development shop that does employ Vagrant to provision their local software development environments during their development phase In this blog post Aaron Volkmann introduces a tool called Otto by Hashicorp the makers of Vagrant Here is an excerpt Vagrant is great for standing up development environments running on a developer laptop but when it comes time to migrate an application to production the environment configuration stored in Vagrant configuration file the Vagrantfile can not be directly used to provision production servers Otto expands upon Vagrant by allowing a single configuration file to define provision and deploy to both development and production environments Otto addresses one of the big challenges in managing micro applications by resolving service dependencies In a micro service architecture a system is broken down into many independent deployable units as opposed to a single monolith This means that we must deploy many small applications instead of one single large application adding management complexity Figure 1 below shows that Your App depends on several services to function To spin up a local development environment a developer would have to know about all these dependencies and configure the Vagrant environment to run them Otto simplifies infrastructure provisioning by traversing the dependency hierarchy and building a Vagrant environment that can accommodate all dependencies If a service on which the application depends has dependencies of its own Otto will automatically resolve fetch and build them Read the complete post 7 Monitoring in the DevOps Pipeline In the realm of DevOps automation often takes the spotlight but nothing is more ubiquitous than the monitoring There is value to increased awareness during each stage of the delivery pipeline However perhaps more than any other aspect of DevOps the act of monitoring raises the question Yes but what do we monitor There are numerous aspects of a project you may want to keep an eye on and dozens of tools from which to choose This blog post by Tim Palko explores what DevOps monitoring means and how it can be applied effectively Here is an excerpt Before getting into the state of monitoring in DevOps I want to take a minute to discuss tooling Because there are so many products trying to promote monitoring choosing among them can be distracting It is best to first understand what holds business value to you and your customers You should also recognize that not everything that can be monitored should be monitored Discussing any particular tool is the aim of this post but it is worth noting that the most vendors offer free trials and many other products are simply free so it might be worth your time to sample a few after you have determined your monitoring strategy Infrastructure and service monitoring have been around long before DevOps so how does DevOps really affect monitoring strategy and is DevOps even needed for monitoring Strangely yes in a way Read the complete post 6 Addressing the Detrimental Effects of Context Switching with DevOps In a computing system a context switch occurs when an operating system stores the state of an application thread before stopping the thread and restoring the state of a different previously stopped thread so its execution can resume The overhead incurred by a context switch managing the process of storing and restoring state negatively impacts operating system and application performance In the blog post Addressing the Detrimental Effects of Context Switching with DevOps Todd Waits describes how DevOps ameliorates the negative impacts that context switching between projects can have on a software engineering team performance Here is an excerpt In the book Quality Software Management Systems Thinking Gerald Weinberg discusses how the concept of context switching applies to an engineering team From a human workforce perspective context switching is the process of stopping work in one project and picking it back up after performing a different task on a different project Just like computing systems human team members often incur overhead when context switching between multiple projects Context switching most commonly occurs when team members are assigned to multiple projects The rationale behind the practice of context switching is that it is logistically simpler to allocate team members across projects than trying to have dedicated resources on each project It seems reasonable to assume that splitting a person effort between two projects yields 50 percent effort on each project Moreover if a team member is dedicated to a single project that team member will be idle if that project is waiting for something to occur such as completing paperwork reviews etc Read the complete post 5 DevOps and Docker Docker is quite the buzz in the DevOps community these days and for good reason Docker containers provide the tools to develop and deploy software applications in a controlled isolated flexible and highly portable infrastructure In the post DevOps and Docker CERT researcher Joe Yankel introduces Docker as a tool to develop and deploy software applications with substantial benefits to scalability resource efficiency and resiliency Here is an excerpt Linux container technology LXC which provides the foundation that Docker is built upon is not a new idea LXC has been in the linux kernel since version when Control Groups or cgroups were officially integrated Cgroups were actually being used by Google as early as 2006 since Google has always been looking for ways to isolate resources running on shared hardware In fact Google acknowledges firing up over 2 billion containers a week and has released its own version of LXC containers called lmctfy or Let Me Contain That For You Unfortunately none of this technology has been easy to adopt until Docker came along and simplified container technology making it easier to utilize Before Docker developers had a hard time accessing implementing or even understanding LXC let alone its advantages over hypervisors DotCloud founder and current Docker chief technology officer Solomon Hykes was on to something really big when he began the Docker project and released it to the world as open source in March 2013 Docker ease of use is due to its API and documentation which enabled the DevOps community to dive in full force and create tutorials official containerized applications and many additional technologies By lowering the barrier to entry for container technology Docker has changed the way developers share test and deploy applications Read the complete post 4 DevOps Case Study Amazon AWS Regular readers of the DevOps blog will recognize a recurring theme in this series DevOps is fundamentally about reinforcing desired quality attributes through carefully constructed organizational process communication and workflow By studying tech companies and their techniques for managing software engineering and sustainment DevOps blog authors have been able to present valuable examples for software engineering approaches and associated outcomes These examples also serve as excellent case studies for DevOps practitioners In the post DevOps Case Study Amazon AWS Aaron Cois explores Amazon experience with DevOps Here is an excerpt Amazon is one of the most prolific tech companies today Amazon transformed itself in 2006 from an online retailer to a tech giant and pioneer in the cloud space with the release of Amazon Web Services AWS a widely used Infrastructure as a Service IaaS offering Amazon accepted a lot of risk with AWS By developing one of the first massive public cloud services they accepted that many of the challenges would be unknown and many of the solutions unproven To learn from Amazon success we need to ask the right questions What steps did Amazon take to minimize this inherently risky venture How did Amazon engineers define their process to ensure quality Luckily some insight into these questions was made available when Google engineer Steve Yegge a former Amazon engineer accidentally made public an internal memo outlining his impression of Google failings and Amazon successes at platform engineering This memo which Yegge has specifically allowed to remain online outlines a specific decision that illustrates CEO Jeff Bezos understanding of the underlying tenets of what we now call DevOps as well as his dedication to what I will claim are the primary quality attributes of the AWS platform interoperability availability reliability and security Read the complete post 3 DevOps Case Study Netflix and the Chaos Monkey While DevOps is often approached through practices such as Agile development automation and continuous delivery the spirit of DevOps can be applied in many ways In this blog post Aaron Cois examines another seminal case study of DevOps thinking applied in a somewhat way by Netflix Here is an excerpt Netflix is a fantastic case study for DevOps because their process shows a fundamental understanding of DevOps thinking and a focus on quality attributes through process Recall DevOps practitioners espouse a driven focus on quality attributes to meet business needs leveraging automated processes to achieve consistency and efficiency Netflix streaming service is a large distributed system hosted on Amazon Web Services AWS Since there are so many components that have to work together to provide reliable video streams to customers across a wide range of devices Netflix engineers needed to focus heavily on the quality attributes of reliability and robustness for both and components In short they concluded that the only way to be comfortable handling failure is to constantly practice failing To achieve the desired level of confidence and quality in true DevOps style Netflix engineers set about automating failure Read the complete post 2 Continuous Integration in DevOps When Agile software development models were first envisioned a core tenet was to iterate more quickly on software changes and determine the correct path via exploration essentially striving to fail fast and iterate to correctness as a fundamental project goal The reason for this process was a belief that developers lacked the necessary information to correctly define project requirements at the onset of a project due to an inadequate understanding of the customer and an inability to anticipate a customer evolving needs Recent research supports this reasoning by continuing to highlight disconnects between planning design and implementation in the software development lifecycle In the blog post Continuous Integration in DevOps Aaron Cois highlights continuous integration to avoid disconnects and mitigate risk in software development projects Here is an excerpt A cornerstone of DevOps is continuous integration CI a technique designed and named by Grady Booch that continually merges source code updates from all developers on a team into a shared mainline This continual merging prevents a developer local copy of a software project from drifting too far afield as new code is added by others avoiding catastrophic merge conflicts In practice CI involves a centralized server that continually pulls in all new source code changes as developers commit them and builds the software application from scratch notifying the team of any failures in the process If a failure is seen the development team is expected to refocus and fix the build before making any additional code changes While this may seem disruptive in practice it focuses the development team on a singular stability metric a working automated build of the software Recall that a fundamental component of a DevOps approach is that to remove disconnects in understanding and influence organizations must embed and fully engage one or more appropriate experts within the development team to enforce a perspective To remove the disconnect between development and sustainment DevOps practitioners include IT operations professionals in the development team from the beginning as full team members Likewise to ensure software quality QA professionals must be team members throughout the project lifecycle In other words DevOps takes the principles of Agile and expands their scope recognizing that ensuring high quality development requires continual engagement and feedback from a variety of technical experts including QA and operations specialists Read the complete post 1 DevOps Technologies Fabric or Ansible In the blog post DevOps Technologies Fabric or Ansible CERT researcher Tim Palko highlights use cases associated with the DevOps deployment process including evaluating resource requirements designing a production system provisioning and configuring production servers and pushing code to name a few Here is an excerpt The workflow of deploying code is almost as old as code itself There are many use cases associated with the deployment process including evaluating resource requirements designing a production system provisioning and configuring production servers and pushing code to name a few In this blog post I focus on a use case for configuring a remote server with the packages and software necessary to execute your code This use case is supported by many different and competing technologies such as Chef Puppet Fabric Ansible Salt and Foreman which are just a few of which you are likely to have heard on the path to automation in DevOps All these technologies have free offerings leave you with scripts to commit to your repository and get the job done This post explores Fabric and Ansible in more depth To learn more about other solutions check out Joe Yankel blog post on Docker or my post on Vagrant One difference between Fabric and Ansible is that while Fabric will get you results in minutes Ansible requires a bit more effort to understand Ansible is generally much more powerful since it provides much deeper and more complex semantics for modeling infrastructure such as those with arrays of web and database hosts From an operator perspective Fabric has a more literal and basic API and uses Python for authoring while Ansible consumes YAML and provides a richness in its behavior which I discuss later in this post We walk through examples of both in this posting Read the complete post Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead In the remaining months of 2016 the DevOps blog will continue to publish guidelines and practical advice to organizations seeking to adopt DevOps in practice with upcoming posts on the following topics Adding Risk Managing Framework into DevOps platform Number of
