at The 30th International Conference on Software Engineering for Debugging Reinvented Asking and Answering Why and Why Not Questions about Program Behavior by Andrew Ko and Brad Myers from may 2018 Keynote address WAPI 1st International Workshop on API Usage and Evolution https with the 39th International Conference on Software Engineering Buenos Aires Argentina Tuesday May 23 2017 Methods for Improving API Usability local pdf and slides and Sven Amann s summary of the talk feb 2018 and apr 2017 Google Faculty Research Awards for API Usability oct 2017 Most Influential Paper award over the last years by the conference in 2017 for Stylos B Myers Mica from 2006 This is the 4th time our group has won this award more news The Natural Programming Project is working on making programming languages APIs and programming environments easier to learn more effective and less error prone We are taking a approach first studying how people perform their tasks and then designing languages APIs and environments around people natural tendencies We focus on all kinds of programming including professional programmers novice programmers who are trying to learn to be experts and programmers EUPs who program to support other jobs or hobbies such as multimedia authoring simulations teaching prototyping and other activities supported by computing We have been affiliated with the EUSES consortium which is a group of researchers working on software engineering and with the project on Variations to Support Exploratory Programming Ongoing Projects API Usability Informing API design choices through methods MARBLE Mining API Repositories for Boilerplate Lessening Effort Mining Software Repositories for Boilerplate to help API Designers Alabaster Autocomplete Letting Apache Beam Applications Succeed Through Exploration Rapidly Research on helping programmers use the Apache Beam API Unakite Users Need Accelerators for Knowledge for Implementations in Technology Environments Research on helping programmers organize knowledge found on the web Obsidian Blockchain State Interaction and Development Implementation And Notation Research on a new language for programming
