Advanced User Interface Software Spring 2020 Advanced User Interface Software Spring 2020 Overview Schedule Homeworks Time and Place Mondays and Wednesdays in GHC 4301 Instructor Brad Myers bam Office NSH 3517 Office Hours By appointment or Course Web page temporarily Piazza page Contents Course Description Why Study This Prerequisites Evaluation Comments Readings Attendance Course Description This course will cover the research and implementation of user interface software The students will get a comprehensive understanding of all the approaches that have been investigated by researchers and commercial systems for user interface software This will be of value to people planning to be user interface researchers or implementers or people interested in learning how to provide user interface frameworks for others After a quick overview of tools to help with the design of user interfaces we will concentrate on how to implement the chosen design The course will cover user interface software tools such as frameworks SDKs or APIs toolkits windowing systems interface builders prototypers and interactive software tools In particular the course will cover toolkits for building user interfaces Internet JavaScript UI frameworks web services and other component frameworks APIs for UI development such as Xcode Windows SDKs Swing and Android toolkits for Java various JavaScript libraries such as AngularJS React and jQuery interactive tools such as Balsamiq Visual Basic and Adobe XD and graphics models for UIs and various research systems like Amulet subArctic Context Toolkit ConstraintJS and Papier Mache Lectures will discuss the fundamental principles behind all of these systems while showing the historical progression of the ideas from research prototypes to commercial systems Other topics will include designing APIs so they are usable by the target programmers and how to evaluate user interface tools and frameworks Today research topics and open issues in user interface software will be emphasized throughout Why Study This A significant percentage of all programming time is spent on the user interface portion across a wide variety of application types and this percentage is increasing as requirements for more complex interfaces grows In addition the tools and methods available for building user interfaces continually change and improve for example new libraries for JavaScript seem to pop up every week Our research shows that a poorly designed API can impact programmer performance by significant amounts and poorly designed UI tools can be a waste of both the and vendor time Therefore it is vital for user interface specialists and software engineers in general to be familiar with the appropriate design of user interface software By the end of the course you will have built your own modern UI framework or SDK for building applications across various platforms which you might find useful for future projects There will also be a final project of your own selection which may be a research contribution possibly suitable for conference submission This course counts as an elective in any of the HCII undergraduate or Master degree programs It counts as a Technical course in the HCII PhD program and it counts as a Design course as in software design in the ISR PhD program Note that this course is only offered occasionally so you should definitely take it now No telling when it will be offered again It was previously offered and so it is on approximately a 3 or cycle Prerequisites This is primarily a MS and PhD level course but some advanced undergrads may be admitted with permission of the instructor Prerequisites are an advanced programming class and considerable programming experience Experience with programming software engineering is strongly recommended However prior experience with user interface design is not required Homeworks will involve extensive programming probably in Java or JavaScript However if you are good programmer but in a different language please let me know To be clear this course is for strong programmers You will need to write about lines of code on your own for the homeworks Just having taken or something like PUI would probably not be sufficient Evaluation Comments from last time this course was offered 2017 Very interesting course I learned a lot of interesting tools and very inspirational ideas about making a tools Material was interesting The class gave some solid background and historical developments I LOVE the style of the homework and LOVE the fact that everything together end up as a complete toolkit It gives a comprehensive understanding on how every little piece come together to form the interactive widgets that we all take as granted The contents of the lectures were quite interesting and covered a huge range of topics Thanks so much Your course inspired me a lot Readings Required text None If you have no prior HCI course you SHOULD buy the Nielsen Usability Engineering book referenced as Nielsen Text in the schedule Articles There is no text that covers the bulk of the course so there will be extensive readings assigned as listed on the schedule In order to prioritize your work I have marked all readings as required or optional The material from the optional group are interesting important articles that a should be familiar with Attendance There will be material covered in class that is not available in the readings so attendance at all class sessions is highly recommended Copyright 2020 Brad Myers Design by Mary Beth Kery
