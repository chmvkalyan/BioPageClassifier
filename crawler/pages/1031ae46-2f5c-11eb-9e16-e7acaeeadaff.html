Engineering Institute Subjects Software Product LinesSoftware Product Lines Abstract A software product line is a set of systems that share a common managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way Software product lines are emerging as a viable and important development paradigm allowing companies to realize improvements in time to market cost productivity quality and other business drivers Software product line engineering can also enable rapid market entry and flexible response and provide a capability for mass customization Benefits Product lines can help organizations overcome the problems caused by resource shortages Organizations of all types and sizes have discovered that a product line strategy when skillfully implemented can produce many ultimately give the organizations a competitive edge Example organizational benefits include Improved productivity Increased quality Decreased cost Decreased labor needs Decreased time to market Ability to move into new markets in months not years This collection includes two decades of SEI work on
