Intelligence SYMSYS 195A A course that builds on the introduction to design in CS147 by focusing on advanced methods and tools for research prototyping and user interface design Studio based format with intensive coaching and iteration to prepare students for tackling real world design problems This course takes place entirely in studios you must plan on attending every studio to take this class The focus of CS247A is design for artificial intelligence experiences What does it mean to design for AI What is HAI How do you create responsible ethical human centered experiences Let us explore what AI actually is and the constraints opportunities and specialized processes necessary to create AI systems that work effectively for the humans involved Prerequisites CS147 or equivalent background in design thinking Terms Aut Spr Units Instructors Stanford J PI CS 247B Design for Behavior Change SYMSYS 195B Over the last decade tech companies have invested in shaping user behavior sometimes for altruistic reasons like helping people change bad habits into good ones and sometimes for financial reasons such as increasing engagement In this course students explore the design of systems information and interface for human use We will model the flow of interactions data and context and crafting a design that is useful appropriate and robust Students will design and prototype utility apps or games as a response to the challenges presented We will also examine the ethical consequences of design decisions and explore current issues arising from unintended consequences Prerequisite CS147 or equivalent Terms Win Units Instructors Wodtke PI CS 247G Introduction to Game Design SYMSYS 195G A course that builds on the introduction to design in CS147 by focusing on advanced methods and tools for research prototyping and user interface design Studio based format with intensive coaching and iteration to prepare students for tackling real world design problems This course takes place entirely in studios please plan on attending every studio to take this class nThe focus of CS247g is an introduction to theory and practice of the design of games We will make digital and paper games do rapid iteration and run user research studies appropriate to game design This class has multiple short projects allowing us to cover a variety of genres from narrative to pure strategy Prerequisites 147 or equivalent background Terms Aut Units Instructors Wodtke PI Li J TA Nicandro TA Zheng TA CS 247I Design for Understanding Complex problems require sophisticated approaches In this course students explore the design of systems information and interface for human use We will model the flow of interactions data and context and crafting a design that is useful appropriate and robust Students will create utility apps or games as a response to the challenges presented We will also examine the ethical consequences of design decisions and explore current issues arising from unintended consequences Prerequisite CS 147 or equivalent Last offered Autumn 2019 Units CS 247S Service Design SYMSYS 195S A course that builds on the introduction to design in CS147 by focusing on advanced methods and tools for research prototyping and user interface design Studio based format with intensive coaching and iteration to prepare students for tackling real world design problems This course takes place entirely in studios you must plan on attending every studio to take this class The focus of CS247S is Service Design In this course we will be looking at experiences that address the needs of multiple types of stakeholders at different touchpoints digital physical and everything in between If you have ever taken an Uber participated in the Draw engaged with your bank or ordered a coffee through the Starbucks app you have experienced a service that must have a coordinated experience for the customer the service provider and any other stakeholders involved Let us explore what specialized tools and processes are required to created these interactions Prerequisites CS147 or equivalent background in design thinking Terms Win Units Instructors Stanford J PI CS 347 Interaction Foundations and Frontiers Previously numbered CS376 How will the future of interaction evolve This course equips students with the major animating theories of interaction and connects those theories to modern innovations in research Major theories are drawn from interaction tangible and ubiquitous computing social computing Johansen matrix and design reflective practitioner wicked problems and span domains such as mixed initiative interaction accessibility ability based design and interface software tools diagrams Students read and comment on multiple research papers per week and perform a research project Prerequisites For CS and Symbolic Systems students CS147 or CS247 No prerequisite for PhD students or students outside of CS and Symbolic Systems Terms Spr Units
