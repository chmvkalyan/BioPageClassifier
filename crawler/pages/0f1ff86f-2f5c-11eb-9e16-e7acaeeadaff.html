Sequestration September 9 2013 SEI Blog Douglas Schmidt Software Architecture Common Operation Platform Environments COPEs Department of Defense DoD program managers and associated acquisition professionals are increasingly called upon to steward the development of complex combat systems In today environment of expanded threats and constrained resources sequestration their focus is on minimizing the cost and schedule of acquisition while simultaneously ensuring interoperability and innovation A promising approach for meeting these challenging goals is Open Systems Architecture OSA which combines 1 technical practices designed to reduce the cycle time needed to acquire new systems and insert new technology into legacy systems and 2 business models for creating a more competitive marketplace and a more effective strategy for managing intellectual property rights in DoD acquisition programs This blog posting expands upon our earlier coverage of how acquisition professionals and system integrators can apply OSA practices to decompose large monolithic business and technical designs into manageable frameworks that can integrate innovation more rapidly and lower total ownership costs Collapsing with Technical Reference Frameworks DoD programs have struggled for decades to move away from solutions towards common operating platform environments COPEs An earlier post in this series described the drawbacks of solutions which lock the DoD into a small number of system integrators each devising proprietary point solutions that are expensive to develop and sustain over the lifecycle Although solutions have been problematic and unsustainable for years the budget cuts occurring under sequestration have motivated the DoD to reinvigorate its focus on identifying alternative means to drive down costs create more affordable acquisition choices and improve acquisition program performance The recently released DoD Better Buying Power policy initiative which superseded Better Buying Power is one such alternative Critical to the success of the Better Buying Power initiatives is the focus on the OSA paradigm which includes a continually evolving integrated business and technical program management strategy that employs modular design publishes standards for key interfaces embraces transparency invigorates enterprise innovation practices and shares risk via systematic reuse of capabilities and assets OSA technical practices which are the focus of this blog posting foster competition and innovation through published open interfaces protocols and data models open standards disclosure modular components and system structures and behaviors Likewise OSA business models which will be the focus of later blog postings in this series use open competition to expand the pool of defense contractors that can participate in DoD acquisition program contracts thereby lowering costs and invigorating innovation The SEI is helping the DoD craft its OSA strategy and produce an implementation plan aimed at helping program managers deliver better capability to warfighters given the fiscal constraints of sequestration A working group has been established to help the DoD move away from software development models to COPEs that embody OSA practices As part of this effort I am serving as of a task area on published open interfaces and standards that is seeking to avoid vendor encourage competition and spur innovation by defining a limited number of technical reference frameworks These frameworks are integrated sets of modular components that provide reusable combat system architectures for families of related warfighting systems Key tenets of technical reference frameworks include improving the quality and affordability of DoD combat systems via the use of modular loosely coupled and architectures that provide many shared capabilities to warfighter applications Examples of these shared capabilities include and utility computing situational awareness and location awareness fully disclosing requirements architecture and design specifications and development work products to program performers The goal of full disclosure is to ensure that competitors and small businesses have sufficient information to implement replacements for key system modules enabling systematic reuse of software and software artifacts such as objects components services data models and associated metadata and deployment plans In a systematic reuse process each new project or product leverages architectures designs and implementations only adding new code that specific to a particular application or service mandating common components based on published open interfaces and standards supported by a range of access to source code and no access to source code providers Open interfaces and standards are essential to spur competition and avoid being locked a specific technology vendor achieving interoperability between hardware software applications and services via common protocols and data models These common protocols and data models simplify data interchange and exchange between components from different suppliers or components implemented using different technologies amortizing the effort needed to create conformance and regression test suites that help to automate the continuous verification validation optimization and assurance of functional requirements and requirements These automated test suites ensure that developers need not wait until final system integration to perform critical functional and evaluations nor must they expend significant effort re creating these tests manually Limiting the number of these technical reference frameworks will increase and reuse opportunities leading to cost savings across the enterprise and across the lifecycle The challenge of course is to define guidance that helps program managers and associated acquisition professionals systematically apply technical reference framework tenets to address technical management and business perspectives in a balanced manner This blog posting together with others we have planned describes how advances in DoD combat system architectures lay the groundwork for success with technical reference frameworks The Architectural Evolution of DoD Combat Systems The technical reference framework approach described above has been applied with varying degrees of maturity and success to DoD combat systems over the past several decades I along with fellow SEI researcher Don Firesmith and Adam Porter from the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science have been documenting the evolution of DoD combat systems with respect to their adoption of systematic reuse and the OSA paradigm described above as shown in the following diagram To view a larger image of this graphic click on the image This diagram shows eight distinct stages along the evolutionary continuum of DoD combat systems The ad hoc architectures in the columns on the left are highly and exhibit little or no shared capabilities among various warfighter capabilities such as communications radars launchers etc The increasingly advanced architectures on the right are intentionally designed to share many capabilities at different levels of abstraction in combat systems including infrastructure capabilities such as internetworking protocols operating systems and various layers of middleware services such as identity managers event disseminators resource allocators and deployment planners common data and domain capabilities such as trackers interoperable data models and mission planners involving battle management control and interaction with sensors and weapons in C4ISR systems external interfaces over the global information grid GIG to external weapon systems as well as sources and users of information In practice production combat systems vary in terms of their progression along the continuum shown in the figure above This visualization simply provides a view of the design space of DoD combat systems with respect to architectural evolution What Ahead This blog posting is the latest in an ongoing series that describes how the SEI is helping acquisition professionals and system integrators apply OSA principles and practices to acquire and sustain innovative warfighting capabilities at lower cost and higher quality Upcoming postings in this series will describe the other stages of DoD combat system architectural evolution shown in the diagram above Subsequent posts will then explore a research effort to help one Navy program obtain accurate estimates of the cost savings and return on investment for both development and lifecycle of several product lines that were built using a common technical
