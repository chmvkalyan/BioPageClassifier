OpportunitiesWorking at the SEI SEI Our Work Projects Software Architecture Software Architecture Created December 2017 For almost two decades the SEI has been instrumental in the creation and development of the field of software engineering known as software architecture Software architecture is the conceptual glue that holds every phase of the project together for its many stakeholders Work With Us Take the Software Architecture Principles and Practices course Get help with problems such as poor quality and slow time to market Attend the annual SATURN Conference Why Architecture The software architecture of a program or computing system is a depiction of the system that aids in understanding how the system will behave Software architecture serves as the blueprint for both the system and the project developing it defining the work assignments that must be carried out by design and implementation teams The architecture is the primary carrier of system qualities such as performance modifiability and security none of which can be achieved without a unifying architectural vision Architecture is an artifact for early analysis to make sure that a design approach will yield an acceptable system By building an effective architecture you can identify design risks and mitigate them early in the development process We can help you create an architecture that responds to critical system qualities Methods for Software Architecture The SEI has a range of proven methods and practices that can help organizations use software architecture to build and evolve systems that satisfy their business and mission goals These methods and practices which are applied at different stages of the development lifecycle have evolved with the advent of Agile development approaches Capture architecturally significant requirements by analyzing the business drivers system context and factors that system stakeholders deem critical to success We use two methods to identify important nonfunctional quality attributes of the system performance dependability security safety and clarify system requirements the Quality Attribute Workshop and the Mission Thread Workshop Design an architecture by developing architectural structures and coordination strategies that satisfy requirements Our Design method helps organizations iteratively design effective architectures Evaluate the architecture by determining its ability to support the quality attributes that meet an organization business and mission goals Our Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM and incremental practices help organizations gain early and ongoing insight into their software architectures Document the architecture in sufficient detail and in an easily accessible form to facilitate communication with developers and other stakeholders and to support analysis Our Views and Beyond approach captures multiple architecture views each addressing the concerns of particular stakeholders The SEI also helped develop the Architecture Analysis and Design Language AADL a architecture modeling language used for systems and the Open Source AADL Tool Environment OSATE AADL and OSATE are used to analyze the performance security and safety of systems How do you know if a software architecture is deficient or at risk relative to its target system qualities The answer is to conduct an evaluation of it A formal software architecture evaluation should be a standard part of the software development lifecycle Architecture evaluation is a way of mitigating the substantial risks associated with this highly important artifact The achievement of a software system quality attributes depends much more on the software architecture than on issues such as language choice design algorithms data structures testing and so forth Most complex software systems are required to be modifiable and have good performance They may also need to be secure interoperable portable and reliable But for any particular system what precisely do these quality security performance Can a system be analyzed to determine these desired qualities How soon can such an analysis occur What happens when these quality attributes are in conflict with each other How can the tradeoffs be examined analyzed and captured Our tools and methods can be used alone or in combination to obtain early and continuous benefits to any software development project The SEI Architecture Technology User Network SATURN Conference SATURN is the leading conference for software architecture practitioners who look beyond the details of today s technologies to the underlying trends techniques and principles that underpin lasting success in our field SATURN attracts attendees from many domains and technical communities who share interests in both practice and research This unique mix makes it the best place to learn exchange ideas and find collaborators at the leading edge of modern software architecture practice The 16th SATURN Conference will be held in Orlando Florida on May 2020 Related Courses and Credentials Based on decades of experience architecting systems and supported by four widely acclaimed books our software architecture training equips software professionals with practices so they can efficiently design systems that meet their intended business and quality goals Learn more
