practical applications of data analytics and machine learning from understanding sensor data to extracting information and decision making in the context of sensed physical systems Many civil engineering applications involve complex physical systems such as buildings transportation and infrastructure systems which are integral to urban systems and human activities Emerging data science techniques and rapidly growing data about these systems have enabled us to better understand them and make informed decisions In this course students will work with data to learn about challenges in analyzing data applications of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques using MATLAB and limitations of the outcomes in contexts Topics include data visualization noise cleansing frequency domain analysis forward and inverse modeling feature extraction machine learning and error analysis Prerequisites CS106A CME Math51 or equivalent Terms Aut Units Instructors Noh PI Autumn CEE 154

graphics sequence introducing students to the technical concepts behind creating synthetic computer generated images In addition to scanline rendering ray tracing is introduced at the beginning of the course since modern consoles now include ray tracing This is followed by discussions of underlying mathematical concepts including triangles normals interpolation mapping acceleration structures etc Importantly the course will discuss handling for image formats computer displays printers as well as how light interacts with the environment constructing engineering models such as the BRDF and various simplifications into more basic lighting and shading models The final class consists of building out a ray tracer to create visually compelling images Starter codes and code bits will be provided to aid in development but this class focuses on what you can do with the code as opposed to what the code itself looks like Therefore grading is weighted toward in person demos of the code in action creativity and the production of impressive visual imagery are highly Prerequisites CS107 MATH51 Terms Aut Units UG Reqs GER Instructors Fedkiw PI Geng Z TA Gorrepati TA more instructors for CS
