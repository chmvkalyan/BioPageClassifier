Office Computing Services Computing Services Information Security Office Training and Awareness Be Aware Social Engineering Using a USB Social Engineering Using a USB Drive When users receive phishing email through certain techniques it is often called social engineering For instance you receive an email explaining that your Yahoo account is about to be disconnected In order to prevent this from happening you are prompted to provide personal information such as your user ID password and full name If you respond to this phishing email with the requested information you will have given a hacker access to your email and to personally identifiable information PII located within your account Social Engineering is thus described as a intrusion that relies on human interaction and often involves tricking other people into breaking normal security procedures There are a variety of tactics used in social engineering some of which are Social Engineering by Phone A hacker calls pretending to be someone in a position of authority to persuade the user into providing sensitive information They could use positions of authority such as impersonating a phone company representative or a bank representative Dumpster Diving Also known as trashing this is when a hacker searches for sensitive information bank statements credit cards and student loans in the garbage Online Social Engineering Hackers often try to trick users into providing sensitive information via email instant messaging chat rooms or social networking sites etc For instance a hacker will send a fraudulent email claiming to be a banking institution credit card company or department store etc They request that the user verify their user name password and user ID either by responding to the email or by clicking on a link that directs the user to a legitimate looking but fake website Reverse Social Engineering This is when a hacker poses as a technical aide to fix a computer problem which they actually created or which does exist The user contacts this aide and is then prompted to give sensitive information to them in order to fix the problem The user provides the required information and the problem seems to be solved USB Drives Hackers can also use USB drives to gain access to sensitive information kept on a computer or network Hackers may infect one or more USB drives with a virus or Trojan that when run will provide hackers with access to logins passwords and information on the user computer or the network the computer is connected to The hacker may then leave the infected USB unattended on the floor in or next to a cluster machine in hallways restrooms or any areas with a relatively high volume of traffic A user who finds a USB drive will often install the device on their computer or on a cluster machine to search for identifiable information that can be used to locate the owner of the USB device This document focuses on social engineering using a USB drive If you suspect that your machine or any machine that you have used to plug in a USB drive was compromised please take the following steps Disconnect the computer from the network Disable the wireless connectivity Contact the Information Security Office ISO at your departmental administrator DSP consultant or Computing Services Help Center at 4357 or Measures of Protection Install and update software Windows Defender Visit Secure Your Computer on the Computing Services website for instructions on downloading using and updating software Install and maintain a firewall For instructions on how to configure Windows Firewall
