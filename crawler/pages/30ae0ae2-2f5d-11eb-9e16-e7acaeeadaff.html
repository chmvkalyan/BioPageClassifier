COVID pandemic has both revealed many of our underlying civilization problems and unleashed a desire for radical change Effective responses will require people who know how to collaborate creatively and confidently and act in systems with In this project based course we will embrace complexity without being paralyzed by it Working on a challenge related to social health and civic fabric political polarization loneliness and social isolation you will practice identifying entry points for change rigorously framing problems and making process and product development decisions by evaluating impact The course draws from HCD systems thinking strategic foresight emotional intelligence and agile team operations to prepare you to be even more successful as a designer researcher product manager entrepreneur or activist If you tend to be more theory oriented this course will get you into action If quick to action this course will give you a wider foundation for making a positive impact

bad habits into good ones and sometimes for financial reasons such as increasing engagement In this course students explore the design of systems information and interface for human use We will model the flow of interactions data and context and crafting a design that is useful appropriate and robust Students will design and prototype utility apps or games as a response to the challenges presented
