Software Engineering Institute Abstract Quality Attribute Workshops QAWs provide a method for identifying a system quality attributes such as availability performance security interoperability and modifiability that are derived from mission or business goals The QAW does not assume the existence of a software architecture It was developed to complement the SEI Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM in response to customer requests for a method to identify important quality attributes and clarify system requirements before there is a software architecture to which the ATAM could be applied Challenges How can you determine which quality attribute requirements are important before a system is built How can you find out stakeholders needs and expectations in an organized and effective way How do you improve and increase communication among stakeholders Description In the QAW an external team facilitates meetings among stakeholders during which scenarios representing the quality attribute requirements are generated prioritized and refined adding additional details such as the participants and assets involved the sequence of activities and questions about quality attributes requirements The process of refining the scenarios allows stakeholders to communicate among themselves thereby exposing assumptions that may not have surfaced during requirements elicitation The refinement also provides insights as to how these attributes interact forming a basis for making tradeoffs between these attributes There may be more than one workshop depending on the number and type of organizations and stakeholders involved in the development maintenance or use of the system The QAW process ends with the list of prioritized refined scenarios The refined scenarios can be used in different ways for example as seed scenarios for ATAM or as test cases in an acquisition effort The QAW involves these steps QAW Presentation and Introductions QAW facilitators describe the motivation for the QAW and explain each step of the method Presentation A representative of the stakeholder community presents the business programmatic drivers for the system Architectural Plan Presentation A technical stakeholder presents the system architectural plans as they stand with respect to early documents such as system descriptions context drawings or other artifacts that describe some of the system technical details Identification of Architectural Drivers Architectural drivers often include requirements concerns goals and objectives and various quality attributes During this step the facilitators and stakeholders reach a consensus about which drivers are key to the system Scenario Brainstorming Stakeholders generate scenarios for the system Scenarios comprise a related stimulus an environmental condition and a response Facilitators ensure that at least one scenario addresses each of the architectural drivers identified in Step 4 Scenario Consolidation Scenarios that are similar in content are consolidated Scenario Prioritization Stakeholders prioritize the scenarios through a voting process Scenario Refinement The top four or five scenarios are further clarified and the following are described the goals that are affected by those scenarios the relevant quality attributes associated with those scenarios In addition stakeholders get a chance to ask questions and raise any concerns they have about those scenarios Organizations can use the QAW results to update the organization s architectural vision refine system and software requirements guide the development of prototypes exercise simulations understand and clarify the system s architectural drivers influence the order in which the architecture is developed describe the system s operation In addition after the architecture is created the scenarios can be used as seed scenarios during an ATAM evaluation Benefits The QAW helps you determine the right qualities for your system before it is that is crucial for system success and for your stakeholders satisfaction Clarifying those requirements and then achieving them in the first version of your system saves money and avoids future rework The QAW provides a structured and efficient setting for communicating with your stakeholders and supports analysis and testing throughout the life of the system The QAW provides a forum for a wide variety of stakeholders to gather in one room at one time early in the development process It is often the first time such a meeting takes place and generally leads to the identification of conflicting assumptions about system requirements Who Would Benefit Organizations that are in the early stage of system development and need to clarify the system s quality attribute requirements and stakeholders expectations for the system Collection Contents Results per page 5 10 20 The SEI Quality Attribute Workshop February 8 2018 Fact Sheet Before you build a software system you need to
