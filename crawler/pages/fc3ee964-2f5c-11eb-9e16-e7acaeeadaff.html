determined by laws of physics Students learn to describe the motion of objects kinematics and then understand why motions have the form they do dynamics Emphasis on how the important physical principles in mechanics such as conservation of momentum and energy for translational and rotational motion follow from just three laws of nature Newton laws of motion Distinction made between fundamental laws of nature and empirical rules that are useful approximations for more complex physics Problems drawn from examples of mechanics in everyday life Skills developed in verifying that derived results satisfy criteria for correctness such as dimensional consistency and expected behavior in limiting cases Discussions based on language of mathematics particularly vector representations and operations and calculus Physical understanding fostered by peer interaction and demonstrations in lecture and discussion sections based on inte more How are motions of objects in

order to register for this class all FROSH must complete the Physics Placement Diagnostic at https Students who complete the Physics Placement Diagnostic by 3 PM Pacific on Friday will have their hold lifted over the weekend Minimum prerequisites High school physics and MATH 20 or high school calculus if sufficiently rigorous Minimum MATH 21 or equivalent Since high school math classes vary widely it is recommended that you take at least one math class at Stanford before or concurrently with taking Physics 41 In addition it is recommended that you take Math 51 or CME 100 before taking the next course in the Physics 40 series Physics 43 Terms Aut Spr Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Graham PI Nanavati PI Tompkins PI more instructors for PHYSICS 41 Instructors Graham PI Nanavati PI Tompkins PI

of Physics 41 4 units for students with little or no high school physics or calculus Course topics and mathematical complexity are identical to Physics 41 but the extra classroom time allows students to engage with concepts develop problem solving skills and become fluent in mathematical tools that include vector representations and operations and calculus The course will use problems drawn from everyday life to explore important physical principles in mechanics such as Newton Laws of motion equations of kinematics and conservation of energy and momentum Prerequisite Math 19 or equivalent Math 20 or equivalent In order to register for this class students must EITHER have already taken an introductory Physics class 20 40 or 60 sequence or have taken the Physics Placement Diagnostic at
