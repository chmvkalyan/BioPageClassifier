President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 3 of 3 results for Physics43 printer friendly page PHYSICS 43 Electricity and Magnetism What is electricity What is magnetism How are they related How do these phenomena manifest themselves in the physical world The theory of electricity and magnetism as codified by Maxwell equations underlies much of the observable universe Students develop both conceptual and quantitative knowledge of this theory Topics include electrostatics magnetostatics simple AC and DC circuits involving capacitors inductors and resistors integral form of Maxwell equations electromagnetic waves Principles illustrated in the context of modern technologies Broader scientific questions addressed include How do physical theories evolve What is the interplay between basic physical theories and associated technologies Discussions based on the language of mathematics particularly differential and integral calculus and vectors Physical understanding fostered by peer interaction and demonstrations in lecture and discussion sections based on interactive group problem solving Prerequisite PHYSICS 41 or equivalent MATH 21 or MATH 51 or
