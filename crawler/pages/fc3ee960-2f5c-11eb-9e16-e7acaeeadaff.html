computational tools for solving practical aerospace engineering problems The course culminates with the treatment of multidisciplinary aerospace problems involving coupling across more than one discipline such as analysis for hypersonic vehicle performance analysis or gas turbine blade cooling interaction problems such as flutter or flapping wing aeroelastic performance and aeroacoustics such as jet noise for next generation commercial supersonic transport or noise radiation from urban air mobility platform Students are expected to pursue significant computational projects in teams
