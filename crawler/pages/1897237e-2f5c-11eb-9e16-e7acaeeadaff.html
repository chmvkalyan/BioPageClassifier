Mike Phillips Software Sustainment Mission Assurance In the SEI examination of the software sustainment phase of the Department of Defense DoD acquisition lifecycle we have noted that the best descriptor for sustainment efforts for software is continuous engineering Typically during this phase the hardware elements are repaired or have some structural modifications to carry new weapons or sensors Software on the other hand continues to evolve in response to new security threats new safety approaches or new functionality provided within the system of systems In this blog post I will examine the intersection of three themes product line practices software sustainment and partnerships that emerged during our work with one government program I will also highlight some issues we have uncovered that deserve further discussion and research Software Product Line Practices Long before our work on this program the SEI began to focus on the concept of software product lines which are a proven way to develop and manage software components more efficiently and at significant cost savings to the producer and its customers who are often diverse customers that receive similar products from a common core software collection While the concept of software product lines has been used effectively in a number of commercial domains the government acquisition environment presents unique challenges Successful product lines are often long lived and some of the systems created from the approach will have entered the sustainment phase Here the amount of software evolution may be more limited than during development but it is likely to be more influenced by real operators at their work stations who want improved utility for their mission Meanwhile other newer systems may still be in the design phase working through the mission threads that guide selection of architectural approaches that best support the key quality attributes for their unique functional approaches In government settings managing a product line is harder because each system is typically considered unique in the acquisition universe The government is obliged to pursue full and open competition for its purchases and avoid procurements whenever possible Government acquisition professionals thus worry about vendor lock that limits healthy competition for needs like stealth fighters or ballistic missile submarines Our research efforts in effective architectures and architectures include years of investigation into how software systems can be created to maximize the value of reusing the majority of system elements a core with new elements to address similar functionality in different hardware packages These software components typically fit within weapon systems or other hardware with very different operating modes For example a system for a surface ship would likely share many capabilities needed for a submarine Command and control of the unique aspects of submarine operation such as diving and surfacing would require that some software systems not be shared across the product line From a software component perspective many computer software configuration items CSCIs would be identical across the product line Some CSCIs might be modestly modified a few might be unique to the specific weapon system under development Software Sustainment Over the years the SEI has worked closely with government organizations dedicated to the continuous evolution of the software content of various military systems laws require government sites to assure the continued readiness of our weapon systems after their development by a contractor Software sustainment was initially viewed as limited to fixing errors with small patches but the need for greater capability has grown including major revisions in software design Consequently engineers have rethought the idea of conventional software maintenance Today they have evolved toward the process as continuous engineering which lies at the intersection of fixing problems and providing new capabilities made possible by new hardware or new threats that demand new functionality In this environment software sustainment needed to become a capability in the government software development centers Partnerships Various laws governing the DoD acquisition of weapon systems recognize that many systems must be maintained long after production The company that built the system may go out of business or move on to different products Code 2464 directs sites to acquire called organic since they are within government rather than commercial or contractor sites needed competencies to preserve wartime capabilities for core systems These systems are identified early in the acquisition cycle Over time Congress added the option for partnerships PPP on government sites to expand sustainment capabilities beyond the limits of government hiring This option provided needed competencies processes and equipment and enabled the prime contractor for a system to establish its presence on a site Program Planning for Transition into Sustainment The SEI brought three themes together when we helped an acquisition organization analyze the software issues of an ACAT I program as it began a product support business case analysis PS BCA We were particularly interested in this case because the systems were developed by a single contractor using strategies for both software and hardware In fact the initial products in the product line were successfully deployed and in operation Based on this success the government is acquiring variants of the system from that contractor The variants were developed by a single contractor using a architecture This approach enabled the contractor to lower the cost and schedule by using common software across the programs But since the programs were funded separately the sustainment planning for each was initially approached separately However continuing the product line as a whole into sustainment offers the government many advantages Working through the options was the task of a team assigned to develop courses of action COAs that would highlight the alternatives and recommend the team preferred option The ultimate decision would be made by senior leadership in the program offices represented Early on the PS BCA team lead gathered the government leadership These leaders represented the new acquisition programs that were part of the contractor suite The programs were scheduled to transition to sustainment at about the same time from 2020 to 2022 The SEI helped the leadership team on matters of software engineering and acquisition These activities made a single PS BCA effort possible The three program leaders agreed that sustainment upgrades could be managed more efficiently if all three programs were considered as part of a product line In this way a single change could be easily offered to each program for integration after initial development But would the initial development be performed by the organic sustainment unit or by the original contractor This choice would be evaluated as part of the PS BCA Each alternative was described as a distinct COA The PS BCA report analyzed the transition from development to sustainment in the lifecycle from three perspectives benefits to the DoD risks of the strategy a cost estimation for the approach There were three fundamental COAs to examine the contractor unit alone the designated organic government software unit alone or some mix of organic and contractor software engineers The best approach for a mix is a partnership PPP as mentioned above To consider the risks and benefits of the COAs 14 reviewers used Likert scale or risk radar scoring against a variety of potential outcomes The aggregate answer favored the PPP over either contactor only or organic only software alternatives Not surprising was that the PPP COA scored highest in providing the most effective balance between organic and contractor support More significantly the experts viewed the PPP as more likely to be more responsive and therefore more likely to ensure greater system availability The experts also deemed the PPP was more flexible and efficient than logistics support The experts viewed the PPP as easier to implement than a transition to pure organic support The final decision must also include cost analysis On this point the approach also showed its strength Earlier work by experts at the SEI found that a solution the point is reached at only two systems A approach thus has immediate payoff for the systems under direct consideration For changes to any additional system added that program would logically pay its portion of the changes with our customer supporting the remainder thereby realizing more savings Consequently this PPP offers the opportunity for the contactor to expand the product line to other DoD services and other government agencies The PPP strategy couples nicely with the approach The shared functionality across the collection of programs that the contractor has mastered suggests maintaining that expertise in the sustainment phase The aspects unique to the various programs with different user communities gives the organic software team the opportunity to do what it does best ongoing and effective communication and support to the warfighter who is geographically close and familiar with the organic team from predecessor systems While the PS BCA analysis has been completed the program leadership of the three acquisition programs have not yet seen the analysis or used it to choose among the alternatives The potential selection of the PPP alternative however creates some interesting future possibilities Looking Ahead Could the government assume full responsibility for the product line at some point This question is not easily answered today but it merits study as the transition goes on Moreover the learning curve for a system of this complexity is long and requires support from the contractor experts While individual transition plans typically span a few years the company has estimated that expertise across the product line would likely take about 10 years to develop It is an open question whether transition of ownership is related to concepts like owning the technical baseline or how it best fits in the sense of government ownership of sustainment efforts for software reliant systems built on a software product line Additional Resources For other blogs in this series please visit http Learn more about the SEI work in product line practices Share About
