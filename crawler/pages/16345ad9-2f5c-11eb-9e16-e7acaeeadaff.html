Crozier Cox Harry Levinson this blog post Legacy systems continue to play a key role across many organizations Engineering cybersecurity into these legacy systems presents some unique challenges In many cases the original design team is no longer available leaving the current team with the challenge of changing designs and software Over the years these systems can become so outdated that they are unable to keep up with new software patterns and development Read More Why Software Architects Must Be Involved in the Earliest Systems Engineering Activities August 12 2019 SEI Blog Sarah Sheard Suzanne Miller Bill Nichols Don Firesmith and Mike Phillips contributed to this post Today major defense systems rely heavily on capabilities However many defense programs acquiring new systems first determine the physical items to develop assuming the contractors for those items will provide all needed software for the capability But software by its nature spans physical items it provides the communications that have a direct influence on most capabilities and thus must be Read More Three Architecture Recommendations for Sustainment Organizations July 1 2019 SEI Blog Susan Crozier Cox In a March 2019 report the Defense Innovation Board DIB a group of advisors focused on bringing the technical advantages employed by Silicon Valley to the Department of Defense DoD noted that the United States faces threats that are evolving at an pace The DIB also noted that the DoD ability to adapt and respond to these threats is now determined by its ability to develop and deploy software to the field rapidly As the DIB Read More A Process for Release Planning April 22 2019 SEI Blog Robert Ferguson Software products are often used for two decades or more Several researchers have shown the cost of maintenance and sustainment ranges between and 80 percent of the total lifecycle cost with a median estimate near 70 percent Sometimes executives have asked Why does software sustainment cost so much This blog turns the question around to ask Can we get better value from our continuing software investment Of course the answer is affirmative We can Read More Governance of a Software Product Line Complexities and Goals January 14 2019 SEI Blog Robert Ferguson My prior blog post on product lines in DoD sustainment described the complexity of contractual relationships in a DoD software product line Recall that a software product line is a collection of related products with shared software artifacts and engineering services that has been developed by a single organization in support of multiple programs serving multiple missions and different customers A product line can reduce cost of development and support In exchange it can be Read More Decisions for Sustaining a Software Product Line October 1 2018 SEI Blog Robert Ferguson A software product line is a collection of related products with shared software artifacts and engineering services that has been developed by a single organization intended to serve different missions and different customers In industry product lines provide both customer benefits such as functionality quality and cost and development organization benefits such as time to market and Moreover these benefits last through multiple generations of products This blog is the first in a series Read More Three Approaches to Adding Flexibility in Software Sustainment Contracting August 27 2018 SEI Blog Julie Cohen This post was by Cecilia Albert and Harry Levinson At the SEI we have been involved in many programs where the intent is to increase the capability of software systems currently in sustainment We have assisted government agencies who have implemented some innovative contracting and development strategies that provide benefits to those programs The intent of the blog is to explain three approaches that could help others in the DoD or federal government agencies Read More Efficient and Effective Software Sustainment of Systems January 29 2018 SEI Blog Mike Phillips In the SEI examination of the software sustainment phase of the Department of Defense DoD acquisition lifecycle we have noted that the best descriptor for sustainment efforts for software is continuous engineering Typically during this phase the hardware elements are repaired or have some structural modifications to carry new weapons or sensors Software on the other hand continues to evolve in response to new security threats new safety approaches or new functionality provided within the Read More Toward Efficient and Effective Software Sustainment November 2 2015 SEI Blog Mike Phillips In my preceding blog posts I promised to provide more examples highlighting the importance of software sustainment in the Department of Defense DoD My focus is on sustaining legacy weapons systems that are no longer in production but are expected to remain a key component of our defense capability for decades to come Despite the fact that these legacy systems are no longer in the acquisition phase software upgrade cycles are needed to refresh Read More An Investment Model for Software Sustainment July 22 2013 SEI Blog Robert Ferguson Software sustainment involves coordinating the processes procedures people information and databases required to support maintain and operate aspects of DoD systems The 2011 book Examination of the Air Force Aircraft Sustainment Needs in the Future and its Strategy to Meet Those Needs states Read More The SEI Blog A Retrospective April 1 2013 SEI Blog Douglas Schmidt In launching the SEI blog two years ago one of our top priorities was to advance the scope and impact of SEI research and development projects while increasing the visibility of the work by SEI technologists who staff these projects After 114 posts and visits from readers of our blog this post reflects on some highlights from the last two years and gives our readers a preview of posts to come Read More Software Producibility for Defense June 4 2012 SEI Blog Bill Scherlis The extent of software in Department of Defense DoD systems has increased by more than an order of magnitude every decade This is not just because there are more systems with more software a similar growth pattern has been exhibited within individual military systems In recognition of this growing software role the Director of Defense Research and Engineering DDR E now ASD R E requested the National Research Council NRC to undertake a study of defense software Read More Toward Efficient and Effective Software Sustainment Second in a Series March 26 2012 SEI Blog Mike Phillips In my preceding blog post I promised to provide more examples highlighting the importance of software sustainmentin the US Department of Defense DoD My focus is on certain configurations of weapons systems that are no longer in production for the United States Air Force but are expected to remain a key component of our defense capability for decades to come and thus software upgrade cycles need to refresh capabilities every 18 to 24 months Throughout Read More Toward Efficient and Effective Software Sustainment February 27 2012 SEI Blog Mike Phillips Our SEI blog has included thoughtful discussions about sustaining software such as the post The Growing Importance of Sustaining Software for the DoD Software sustainment is growing in importance as the lifetimes of hardware systems greatly exceed the normal lifetime of software systems they are partnered with as well as when system functionality increasingly depends on software elements This blog post the first in a series provides specific examples of the importance of software sustainment Read More The Growing Importance of Sustaining Software for the DoD Part 2 August 15 2011 SEI Blog Douglas Schmidt Software sustainment is growing in importance as the inventory of DoD systems continues to age and greater emphasis is placed on efficiency and productivity in defense spending In part 1 of this series I summarized key software sustainment challenges facing the DoD In this blog posting I describe some of the R D activities conducted by the SEI to address these challenges Read More The Growing Importance of Sustaining Software for the DoD Part 1 August 1 2011 SEI Blog Douglas Schmidt Department of Defense DoD programs have traditionally focused on the software acquisition phase initial procurement development production and deployment and largely discounted the software sustainment phase operations and support until late in the lifecycle The costs of software sustainment are becoming too high to discount since they account for 60 to 90 percent of the total software lifecycle effort Read More Subscribe SEI Blog RSS SEI Blog Mailing List SEI Blog
