President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 4 of 4 results for EE 264 Digital Signal Processing printer friendly page EE 264 Digital Signal Processing Digital signal processing DSP techniques and design of DSP applications Topics include random signals sampling and systems oversampling and quantization in conversion properties of LTI systems quantization in implementations of filters digital filter design discrete Fourier Transform and FFT spectrum analysis using the DFT parametric signal modeling and adaptive filtering The course also covers applications of DSP in areas such as speech audio and communication systems The optional lab section Section 02 provides a opportunity to explore the application of DSP theory to practical applications in an embedded processing platform See for more information Register in Section 02 to take the lab Undergraduate students taking the lab should register for 4 units to meet the EE design requirement The optional lab section is not available to remote SCPD students Prerequisites EE 102A and EE 102B or equivalent basic programming skills Matlab and Terms Win Units Instructors Mujica PI
