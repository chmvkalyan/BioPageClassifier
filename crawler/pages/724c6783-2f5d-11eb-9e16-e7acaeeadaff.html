174B PHIL 274B The past three decades have seen the elaboration of a vast body of literature on unconditional basic income a radical policy proposal Philippe Van Parijs referred to as a disarmingly simple idea It consists of a monthly cash allowance given to all citizens regardless of personal desert and without means test to provide them with a standard of living above the poverty line The seminar will seek to engage students in normative debates in political theory feminism liberalism republicanism communism libertarianism etc by appealing to the concrete example of basic income It will allow students to learn a great deal about a policy that is gaining tremendous currency in academic and public debates while discussing and learning about prominent political theorists many of whom have written against or for basic income at one point in their seminar is open to undergraduate and graduate students in all departments There are no We will ask questions such as is giving people cash no strings attached desirable and just Would basic income promote a more gender equal society through the remuneration of or would it risks further entrenching the position of women as Would alternative policies be more successful such as the job guarantees stakeholder grants or a negative income tax How can we test out basic income What makes for a reliable and ethical basic income pilot Students in Politics Philosophy Public Policy Social Work and Sociology should find most of those questions relevant to their interests Some discussions on how to fund basic income on the implications of basic income and on the existing pilots projects in Finland Namibia India Canada and the US may be of interest to Economists while our readings on the impact of new technologies and artificial intelligence on the future of work and whether a basic income could be a solution are likely to be on interest to computer scientists and engineers By the end of the class students will have an in depth knowledge of the policy and will have developed skills in the normative analysis of public policy They will be able to deploy those critical and analytical skills to assess a broad range of other policies Terms Spr Units 4 Repeatable for credit Instructors Bidadanure J PI Ceballos TA Lenczewska O TA Spring POLISCI 338 4 units Class 32052 Section 01 Grading Letter or Credit LEC
