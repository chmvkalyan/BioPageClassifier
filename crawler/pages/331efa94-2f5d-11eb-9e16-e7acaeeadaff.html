President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 4 of 4 results for CS148 printer friendly page CS 148 Introduction to Computer Graphics and Imaging Introductory prerequisite course in the computer graphics sequence introducing students to the technical concepts behind creating synthetic computer generated images In addition to scanline rendering ray tracing is introduced at the beginning of the course since modern consoles now include ray tracing This is followed by discussions of underlying mathematical concepts including triangles normals interpolation mapping acceleration structures etc Importantly the course will discuss handling for image formats computer displays printers as well as how light interacts with the environment constructing engineering models such as the BRDF and various simplifications into more basic lighting and shading models The final class consists of building out a ray tracer to create visually compelling images Starter codes and code bits will be provided to aid in development but this class focuses on what you can do with the code as opposed to what the code itself looks like Therefore grading is weighted toward in person demos of the code in action creativity and the production of impressive visual imagery are highly Prerequisites CS107 MATH51 Terms Aut Units UG Reqs GER Instructors Fedkiw PI Geng Z TA

controlling movements Students will be exposed to integrated knowledge and techniques across computer graphics robotics machine learning and biomechanics The topics include numerical integration 3D character modeling keyframe animation dynamics human kinematics muscle dynamics trajectory optimization learning policies for motor skills and motion capture Students who successfully complete this course will be able to use and modify physics simulator for character animation or robotic applications to control policies for locomotion or manipulation tasks on virtual agents and to leverage motion capture data for synthesizing realistic virtual humans The evaluation of this course is based on three assignments and an research project Recommended Prerequisite CS148 or CS205A Terms Spr
