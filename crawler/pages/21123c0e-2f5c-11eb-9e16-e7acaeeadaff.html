station target for industrial process control Apart from designing the hardware configuration and deciding which RTOS is most appropriate for our application we also need a User Interface Builder We already have some information about the following products Zinc UTAH WNDX Sammi zApp As I said we contacted the distributers of the mentioned products and asked for information as regards possible development systems possible systems multi lingual support standard price special price policy for limited time to be used during the project development phase approximately 2 years The material in general gave us the answers we were looking for However we would like to hear the opinion of an expert on these software products somebody who has not the prior intention to sell his product Any hint is highly appreciated since we never used one of this software Review R5 The X Journal 1992 Product Review John Theung If you need graphs is a widget no serious developer should be without Review R6

Builder Xcessory September 1997 issue of Unix Review Review R12 ToolName IconAuthor Director Visual Basic Vendor Asymetrix MacroMind Microsoft applicationtype catalogues office tools corporate tools database frontends CBT Review from 22 Jul 97 I favour the Iconbased flowchart which represents actual programming structure The integration of objects instances of objects their properties and the programming structure in one development environment is a real improvement compared with separate environments in earlier versions of IA Multiplatform Win16 Win32 OS2 Unix do well MacOS does not Inter net Almost every thing you want Database Not as well as JetEngine in Visual Basic but ODBC very well integrated though at the cost of performance Performance Runtime better then Authorware Director Toolbook Quest worse then Visual Basic Development time and mastering Mastering IconAuthor at a startlevel is very easy advanced techniques and good authoring techniques take relative more time Development is faster after a longer experience and with reuse of structures subroutines Developing in Visual Basic seems to be faster in somecases and has a better performance but is not multiplatform Director has an obscure interface metaphor but lingo is great for scripting Performance of Director is not great in user responce but better in graphics Review R13 ToolName VXP Vendor Yong Chen applicationtype Astronomical and scientific data collection and control applications Review from 13 Jul 97 VXP is an impressive single person effort The interface is well done and the available widget selection is adequate for most applications However the package lacks the ability for the user to incorporate additional widgets and the code generation appears to be locked into a rigid format This presents a serious problem when using VXP with something like VxWorks and the WindX Motif package for that system A considerable amount of hacking is required to get the generated code into a condition where it will compile and run gracefully under VxWorks Although the author does not charge for the package he also does not release the sources instead insisting that he be given access to a new target system in order to port the package This may not be acceptable for many sites The lack of available sources for VXP will probably spell its demise since it is not comprehensive enough in its present form for serious development work and the author does appear to be putting any significant amount of effort into it recently This is unfortunate since VXP could be a serious contender in the GUI tools arena In spite of all this VXP is still worth checking out and it may turn out to be useful for some projects Note R14 VISIX SETTLES WITH CUSTOMERS HOPES TO SELL ASSETS 24 Apr 1998 Visix Software Inc has now confirmed it is in the process of being dissolved CI No following what a spokesperson described as a sudden forced decision by the board and management The skeleton staff that will remain at Reston Visix will now concentrate on recovering as much value as they can from the assets It is talking to customers about source code licenses to the Visix Galaxy application development environment so that they can carry out their own ongoing maintenance and support Some already have source code escrow licenses but under varying terms Visix says it also in talks with one or two companies about the sale of the Galaxy technology itself but would like a few more to talk to It would give no indication of the likelihood of any talks being successful Visix has between 100 and 200 customers who have licensed its technology ranging from small companies to giants such as JP Morgan and Bellcore Some of those customers have already banded together to form an independent support group at the web site http CAMPINAS Brazil 17 December 1998 Ambiencia Information Systems a Florida company announced today that it has acquired the Galaxy Application Environment
