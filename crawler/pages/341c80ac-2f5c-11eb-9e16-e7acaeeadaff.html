and becomes 30 Lee Simmons Email Narcissists are adept at and often shine in job interviews Charles O Reilly says Which means the depth of their pathology doesn t reveal itself until they gain power Illustration by Alvaro Dominguez What traits do we look for in our leaders Ask someone what distinguishes a forceful leader in business or politics and they re likely to mention and charisma Great leaders we say are bold and They have a vision for creating something new or remaking a company or a country They challenge conventional wisdom and are slowed by neither nor criticism These are the individuals whom corporate boards tend to select as CEOs especially in times of upheaval when the status quo is failing They re adept at and shine in job interviews Then once they re in power we find out who they really are Sometimes they re as good as their promise But many turn out to be not just confident but arrogant and entitled Instead of being bold they re merely impulsive They lack empathy and exploit others without compunction They ignore expert advice and treat those who differ with contempt and hostility Above all they demand personal loyalty They are in short raging narcissists Charles O Reilly the Frank Buck Professor of Management at Stanford Graduate School of Business studies how the personalities of leaders shape the culture of organizations and the behavior of those who work in them In a paper with Jennifer Chatman of the University of California Berkeley he reviews the literature on narcissistic leaders encompassing more than 150 studies and draws some somber and urgent conclusions There are leaders who may be abusive jerks but aren t really narcissists O Reilly says The distinction is what motivates them Are they driven to achieve some larger purpose Do they really want to make the company or the country better or accomplish some crazy goal like making electric cars mainstream and maybe colonizing Mars along the way Or is it really all about their own aggrandizement When their has some basis in reality narcissistic leaders can achieve great things that was certainly the case with Steve Jobs at Apple But over the past decade researchers have grown increasingly concerned by the destructive effects of narcissists on organizations Cautionary tales abound from Enron to Uber to Theranos True narcissists O Reilly says are and lack integrity They believe they re superior and thus not subject to the same rules and norms Studies show they re more likely to act dishonestly to achieve their ends They know they re lying and it doesn t bother them They don t feel They are also often reckless in the pursuit of glory sometimes successfully but often with dire consequences But even worse narcissists change the companies or countries they lead much like bad money drives out good and those changes can outlast their own tenure O Reilly says Divergent voices are silenced flattery and servility are rewarded and cynicism and apathy corrode any sense of shared purpose in a culture where everyone s out for themselves In the extreme they can destroy the institution itself Why Do We Empower Them Anyone who was bullied as a kid is familiar with the consoling notion that bullies don t really believe they re better than us they re just compensating for low They present as confident and assertive to mask some inner pain and we take solace in their secret suffering maybe feigning pity for their brokenness Unfortunately that generous assessment is not always true That s the classic case of vulnerable narcissism recognized in psychiatry O Reilly says But in the last decade or so there s been an outpouring of research on what s called grandiose narcissism These individuals have high They are much more agentic more extroverted and really more dangerous And evidence shows that they re achieving high positions in organizations getting promoted and making more money than normal Such individuals seek positions of power where they can be admired and can demonstrate their superiority And they tend to gain those posts because they look like prototypical leaders There must be 20 or 30 studies that demonstrate this O Reilly says If you gather a group of strangers and give them a task those who are more narcissistic are much more likely to be selected as You end up with these individualistic cultures with no teamwork and low integrity We ve documented this in a bunch of Silicon Valley tech O Reilly O Reilly thinks we may especially tend to choose narcissistic leaders in times of turmoil In the last few decades big companies like automakers and banks have been threatened by technological disruption So you could imagine that in anxious times people are looking for a hero a confident person who says I have a They may be the only ones who are confident in such times By the way he adds I haven t researched this but I think venture capitalists love these people For their business model which is to invest in 10 companies hoping that one pays off big it makes sense If I m a VC and I see one startup that s headed by an introverted engineer and another that s led by someone who says Yeah I m going to change the word and if you don t get it then you re a bozo I m going to go for the visionary In a way it s an investment model predicated on grandiosity Tallying the Damage Because narcissists are fundamentally driven by their own lack empathy and are less constrained by ethical standards they can cause tremendous harm once in power and can even put the organizations they lead at risk O Reilly says Field studies have shown that narcissistic CEOs are more likely to engage in fraud and other types of crime manipulate earnings and pursue aggressive tax avoidance And a 2013 study of presidents found that those who scored higher on the narcissism scale were more likely to abuse their authority not to mention on a personal level their marriage vows Along with Bernadette Doerr of UC Berkeley O Reilly recently published the results of three experiments showing that narcissistic people in general have lower levels of integrity meaning their words and deeds do not align and that that they are more likely to lie cheat and steal in order to prove their special status Ascending to a position of power only reinforces these tendencies O Reilly says Being elected or appointed to office validates their sense of entitlement At the same time even without narcissism power disinhibits it encourages people to indulge their worst instincts so now you ve got the two working And when narcissists do achieve some success it reinforces their belief that they know better than others so that they feel even more justified in ignoring the advice of experts and relying on their own instincts Success chips away at their hold on reality O Reilly writes in his review Not surprisingly studies also show that narcissists belief in their superiority is based on scant evidence validated neither by objective measures of intelligence or competence nor by performance reviews from peers or subordinates One recent paper on corporate found that grandiosity in leaders was associated with greater but not better financial returns As a result narcissists often feel they don t receive the admiration and credit they deserve and they can seem pathologically consumed with resentment That can take the form of petulance aggression unhinged public rants and abuse of underlings Narcissistic CEOs often involve their firms in costly litigation In the narcissist s worldview other human beings must be either acolytes or enemies But the gravest danger posed by such leaders is that their malignant influence guides the behavior and expectations of others and ultimately shapes the culture of the organization or polity in their own image Studies of businesses show that unethical behavior at the top cascades through the organization and becomes legitimized or at least normalized Once they re in power narcissists consolidate their position by firing everyone who challenges them O Reilly says In their place rise a plague of toadies opportunists and enablers equally guided by and short on scruples So you end up with these individualistic cultures with no teamwork and low integrity We ve documented this in a bunch of Silicon Valley tech When you join a new company you figure out how you need to behave to fit in he says If you see that the path upward requires you to scheme suck up and withhold information then you have a choice You can either do the same or not in which case you re going to be excluded and probably He points to the struggles of Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to turn the company around after its founding CEO Travis Kalanick was forced out Once you create these cultures it s very hard to change them There are Follow the Trail O Reilly s hope is that by pulling together the lessons from what is now a large body of research on narcissistic leadership we can learn to better distinguish between real transformational leaders and the who exploit our hopes and fears to gain power If you re evaluating candidates for high office you really need to look beyond the he says Too often when boards select CEOs especially outside CEOs they do it through interviews But interviews play to the strength of a narcissist And you can t just look at performance because they can fake performance blithely taking credit for others work and even falsifying results What would really be far more illuminating would be to go talk to the people who ve worked for them and with them in the past You have to get data from people who have seen that person operating But that typically isn t what It s up to the hiring teams and voters who select leaders O Reilly says to do the proper background checks We re not helpless The information is out And as research shows the stakes are high because as O Reilly says These people aren t going to Organizational Behavior Corporate
