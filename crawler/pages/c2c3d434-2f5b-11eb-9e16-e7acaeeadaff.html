Assess Teaching Learning Basics Grading vs Assessment What is the difference between assessment and grading Assessment and grading are not the same Generally the goal of grading is to evaluate individual students learning and performance Although grades are sometimes treated as a proxy for student learning they are not always a reliable measure Moreover they may incorporate criteria such as attendance participation and effort that are not direct measures of learning The goal of assessment is to improve student learning Although grading can play a role in assessment assessment also involves many ungraded measures of student learning such as concept maps and CATS Moreover assessment goes beyond grading by systematically examining patterns of student learning across courses and programs and using this information to improve educational practices HOME Faculty Support Graduate Student Support Canvas Carnegie Mellon Quick Links Who We Are Eberly Center Eberly 412 Carnegie
