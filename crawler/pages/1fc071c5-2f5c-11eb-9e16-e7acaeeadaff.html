Interaction Techniques Spring 2019 Interaction Techniques Spring 2019 Schedule Homeworks Homework Policies formerly also had number See the list of all previous times this course was offered Intended for Undergraduates Masters and PhD students Time MW Room GHC 4211 12 University Units Instructor Brad Myers Office Hall NSH 3517 Phone bam Office hours TBD or by appointment TA Asit Parida akparida Office hours TBD Description This course will provide a comprehensive study of the many ways to interact with computers and computerized devices An interaction technique starts when the user does something that causes an electronic device to respond and includes the direct feedback from the device to the user Examples include physical buttons and switches menus and scroll bars operated by a mouse touch screen widgets and gestures such as text entry on computers or touch screens consumer electronic controls such as remote controls game controllers and adaptations of all of these for people with disabilities We will start with a history of the invention and development of these techniques discuss the various options used today and continue on to the future with the latest research on interaction techniques presented at conferences such as ACM CHI and UIST Guest lectures from inventors of interaction techniques are planned Students will have a choice for final projects that can focus on historical or novel interaction techniques For example one option will be to create a novel technique perform a user study of it and write a paper about the result which may be suitable for conference submission Last time a group inventing a new way to do text entry on a watch did get a publication Another option is to create a Wikipedia page about an inventor or interaction technique Or you could investigate and write a paper or make a video about the history and various previous designs for widely used interaction techniques possibly including an interview with the inventor s After taking this course students will be able to Articulate design issues regarding interaction techniques Design a new interaction technique given a set of requirements and constraints Evaluate interaction techniques using the appropriate tests for performance and usability Describe the historical progression of the most important interaction techniques and the factors that impacted their evolution and eventual widespread adoption Schedule and Homeworks A tentative schedule for the course and topics for class periods is available There will definitely be changes Confirmed guest speakers this year include Bill Atkinson contributor to many early Apple Lisa and Machintosh interactions including the marching ants selection the menu bar the Selection lasso FatBits MacPaint HyperCard menus and many others Dan Bricklin inventor of Spreadsheets VisiCalc Shumin Zhai Google inventor of ShapeWriter text entry for smartphones like Swype and the Google Pixel phone squeeze interactions Active Edge Don Hopkins Pie menus Rob Haitani UI designer on the orginal Palm Pilot See also the Homework list and homeworks policies The index for previous year materials is also available Prerequisites Students must have taken at least some introductory HCI course such as DHCS UCRE PUI SSUI Intro HCI Tech Exec or equivalent Preference will be given to students in the degree programs of the HCII Undergrad Minor in HCI BS in HCI Students do not need to know how to program we would especially like to invite students interested in the history of computation to enroll Note if you have a focus on the history of technology but no courses in HCI we may be willing to make an exception to that requirement email the professor Nice Comments from Last Time Interaction Techniques is my favorite course this semester This was a very informational course I loved learning about all the history of the different interaction techniques and where they come from I learned a lot from Professor experience and insights Every lecture was fun It was a great and thorough overview of many different forms of interaction I liked how it was a very comprehensive study or description of a wide variety of interaction techniques I just been using all of these before without knowing the thought process made behind them I liked best the freedom of projects Interesting and engaging homeworks Nice range of topics use of as well as our own explorations It is a very cool course that covers the topic very well What is an Interaction Technique Informally it describes things like menus scroll bars text entry fields typing on a with an keyboard gestural interfaces like flicking to scroll etc More formally here are some definitions My definition An interaction technique starts when the user does something that causes a computer to respond and includes the direct feedback from the computer to the user Interaction techniques are generally reusable across various applications Wikipedia s definition An interaction technique user interface technique or input technique is a combination of hardware and software elements that provides a way for computer users to accomplish a single task Foley van Dam 1990 textbook definition An interaction technique is a way of using a physical device to perform a generic task in a dialogue Final Project Ideas It is expected that everyone in the class will do a final project probably in teams of 2 to 4 students Here are some ideas for final projects Create or edit a Wikipedia page about an interaction technique or about an inventor of one with appropriate citations Previous years projects created new pages for David Canfield Smith and Norm Cox the entire page and the history section for scrollbars http and some others I promised Shumin Zhai that someone would make a page for him so I hoping a group will be excited about this project Fix up the tests for homeworks 1 3 and 4 Especially the scrolling test is problematic but the Fitts Law test can be better too I think we also need an implementation of Wobbrock test in JavaScript Can we come up with tests that work on watches Help with Myers book about Interaction Techniques Document evaluate analyze and critique one or more existing interaction techniques with appropriate evidence Maybe compare it with alternatives with a user study Maybe prepare a chapter for the encyclopedia about it Maybe update the All the Widgets video with changes in this interaction technique since 1990 or create a new section Pick a new or relatively new hardware pointing device or text editing and do a thorough analysis of it a Leap Motion pointing device Pick a particular important milestone design and enumerate and describe all of the novel interaction techniques introduced in that system For example what interaction techniques were first introduced in the Star Lisa Macintosh Windows 95 iPhone etc Interview an inventor of a particular interaction technique Most of them are still alive and Professor Myers is personally acquainted with many of them Create a video audio paper report Do a thorough analysis of the data the class collected for homeworks 1 3 or 4 Reimplement some of the old techniques old scroll bars Xerox Star method for text editing etc and possibly do a user test to see if they were actually worse than current versions Invent a new interaction technique Implement or prototype it Do a user study of the result Write a paper discussing the design issues and evaluation and optionally submit it to an appropriate conference See example from last time Elliot Lockerman Shuobi Wu Ariel Rao Jarret Lin Neil Bantoc and Brad Myers Smartwatch Text Entry Using Five to Seven Physical Keys 2017 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Computing October 11 2017 Raleigh NC pp local pdf Create a project of your own design in consultation with the professor
