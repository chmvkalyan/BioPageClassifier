Towards More Natural Functional Programming Languages Towards More Natural Functional Programming Languages By Brad Myers Human Computer Interaction Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Keynote talk given at the The ACM International Conference on Functional Programming ICFP 2002 October 2002 Pittsburgh Abstract Programming languages are the way for a person to express a mental plan in a way that the computer can understand Therefore it is appropriate to consider properties of people when designing new programming languages In our research we are investigating how people think about algorithms and how programming languages can be made easier to learn and more effective for people to use By taking aspects of programming languages seriously designers can more effectively match programming language features with human capabilities and problem solving methods Human factors methods can be used to measure the effects so unsubstantiated claims can be avoided This talk will present a quick summary of new and old results in what is known about people and programming from areas that are sometimes called empirical studies of programmers and psychology of programming Much is known about what people find difficult and what syntax and language features are especially tricky and Our new research has discovered how people naturally think about algorithms and data structures which can help with making programming languages more closely match people s problem solving techniques Links Brad Myers ICFP Presentation slides in PowerPoint format megabytes abstract of the talk pdf format The Natural Programming Project web page at CMU A report on the usability of various programming languages as evaluated using HCI principles Description of the HANDS system including link to view the video
