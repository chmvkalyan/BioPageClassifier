exception of large companies such as Google and Microsoft development of ML capabilities is Read More Three Risks in Building Machine Learning Systems May 18 2020 SEI Blog Benjamin Cohen Machine learning ML systems promise disruptive capabilities in multiple industries Building ML systems can be complicated and challenging however especially since best practices in the nascent field of AI engineering are still coalescing Consequently a surprising fraction of ML projects fail or underwhelm Behind the hype there are three essential risks to analyze when building an ML system 1 poor problem solution alignment 2 excessive time or monetary cost and 3 unexpected behavior once deployed Read More Automatically Detecting Technical Debt Discussions with Machine Learning April 13 2020 SEI Blog Robert Nord Technical debt TD refers to choices made during software development that achieve goals at the expense of quality Since developers use issue trackers to coordinate task priorities issue trackers are a natural focal point for discussing TD In addition software developers use preset issue types such as feature bug and vulnerability to differentiate the nature of the task at hand We have recently started seeing developers explicitly use the phrase technical debt or Read More Using Machine Learning to Detect Design Patterns March 16 2020 SEI Blog Robert Nord This post was by Zachary Kurtz Software increasingly serves core DoD functions such as ship and plane navigation supply logistics and situational awareness The complexity of software however makes it hard to evaluate software quality The ability to evaluate software is critical both for software developers and for DoD program managers who are responsible for software acquisitions The quality of software can make or break a program budget Quality attributes such as reliability Read More Summarizing and Searching Video with Machine Learning March 2 2020 SEI Blog Edwin Morris The relies on surveillance video to determine when activities of interest occur in a location that is under surveillance Yet because automated tools are not available to help analysts monitor video or analyze archived video analysts must dedicate full attention to video data streams to avoid missing important information about ongoing activities and patterns of life In tactical settings warfighters miss critical information that would improve situational awareness because dedicating full attention to Read More Artificial Intelligence in Practice Securing Your Code Using Natural Language Processing October 7 2019 SEI Blog Eliezer Kanal Many techniques are available to help developers find bugs in their code but none are perfect an adversary needs only one to cause problems In this post I discuss how a branch of artificial intelligence called natural language processing or NLP is being applied to computer code and cybersecurity NLP is how machines extract information from naturally occurring language such as written prose or transcribed speech Using NLP we can gain insight into the code Read More The Latest Work from the SEI AI Deepfakes Automated Alert Handling and Cyber Intelligence September 2 2019 SEI

growing number of Department of Defense DoD data problems are graph problems the data from sources such as sensor feeds web traffic and supply chains are full of irregular relationships that require graphs to represent explicitly and mathematically For example modern test and evaluation produces massive heterogeneous datasets and analysts can use graphs to reveal otherwise hidden patterns in these data affording the DoD a far more complete understanding of a system effectiveness survivability Read More The Vectors of Code On Machine Learning for Software June 10 2019 SEI Blog Zachary Kurtz This blog post provides a light technical introduction on machine learning ML for problems of computer code such as detecting malicious executables or vulnerabilities in source code Code vectors
