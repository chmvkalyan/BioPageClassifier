courses LINGUIST 1 Introduction to Linguistics This course is targeted to students with no linguistics background The course is designed to introduce and provide an overview of methods findings and problems in eight main areas of linguistics Phonetics Phonology Morphology Syntax Semantics Pragmatics Psycholinguistics and Sociolinguistics Through lectures activities and problem sets you will come away with an overview of various linguistic phenomena a sense of the diversity across languages skills of linguistic analysis an awareness of connections between these linguistics and applications of linguistics more broadly and a basis for understanding the systematic but complex nature of human language While much of the course uses English to illuminate various points you will be exposed to and learn to analyze languages other than English By the end of the course you should be able to explain similarities and differences of human languages use basic linguistic terminology appropriately apply the tools of linguistic analysis to problems and puzzles of linguistics understand the questions that drive much research in linguistics and explain how understanding linguistics is relevant for a variety of phenomena Terms Aut Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Hilton PI Kim J TA Portelance TA Twiner TA LINGUIST 106 Introduction to Speech Perception Basics of acoustic phonetics and audition

Instructors Anttila A PI Krejci B TA LINGUIST 116A Introduction to This course provides an introduction to word formation in the languages It investigates the notion of word the internal structure of words the relation between a word structure and its meaning and processes for forming new words Data will be drawn from a range of languages with an emphasis on English Prerequisites One of Linguist 1

diverse array of the world languages including but not limited to English Emphasis is on understanding how languages are systematically alike and different in their basic sentence structure The course focuses on building up syntactic argumentation skills via the collective development of a partial formal theory of sentence structure which attempts to model native speaker knowledge Satisfies the WIM

LINGUIST 130B Introduction to Lexical Semantics Introduction to basic concepts and issues in the linguistic study of word meaning We explore grammatical regularities in word meaning and the relation between word meaning and the conceptual realm The questions we address include the following How is the meaning of a word determined from its internal structure How can simple words have complex meanings What is a possible word How does a meaning determine the word syntactic distribution and what kind of reasoning does it support What kind of information belongs to the lexical entry of a word The course will show that the investigation of the linguistic and semantic structure of words draws on the full resources of linguistic theory and methodology Prerequisites Symsys 1 Linguist 35 or

to Psycholinguistics LINGUIST 245A PSYCH 140 How do people do things with language How do we go from perceiving the acoustic waves that reach our ears to understanding that someone just announced the winner of the presidential election How do we go from a thought to spelling that thought out in a sentence How do babies learn language from scratch This course is a practical introduction to psycholinguistics the study of how humans learn represent comprehend and produce language The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of both the research methodologies used in psycholinguistic research and many of the findings in the field Topics covered will include visual and auditory recognition of words sentence comprehension reading discourse and inference sentence production language acquisition language in the brain and language disorders Students will conduct a small but original research project and gain experience with reporting and critiquing psycholinguistic research Terms Aut Units 4 Instructors Degen J PI Clapp TA Lu J TA LINGUIST 160 Introduction to Language Change Principles of historical linguistics the nature of language change Kinds and causes of change variation and diffusion of changes through populations differentiation of dialects and languages determination and classification of historical relationships among languages

the linguistic subfield concerned with comparing and classifying world languages The course provides an overview of the analytic tools which may be used to identify and classify a language based on its phonological morphological and syntactic properties and explores the major ways in which languages may be similar or different in these domains Students will acquire a useful toolkit for studying
