accelerating applications with GPUs Graphics Processing Units GPU programming with CUDA and OpenACC debugging profiling optimization debugging and other CUDA tools Libraries to easily accelerate compute code will be presented and deployment on larger systems will be addressed including environments Several practical examples will be detailed including deep learning knowledge of at the level of CME211 or CS106b Last offered Winter 2017 CME 257 Advanced Topics in Scientific Computing with Julia This course will rapidly introduce students to the Julia programming language with the goal of giving students the knowledge and experience necessary to navigate the language and package ecosystem while using Julia for their own scientific computing needs The course will begin with learning the basics of Julia and then introduce students to git version control and package development Additional topics include common packages parallelism interfacing with shared object libraries and aspects of Julia implementation core numerical linear algebra Lectures will be interactive with an emphasis on collaboration and learning by example Prerequisites Data structures at the level of CS106B experience with one or more scientific computing languages Python Matlab or R and some familiarity with the Unix shell No prior experience with Julia or git is required Last offered Autumn 2019 CS 41 Code The Python Programming Language This course is about the fundamentals and contemporary usage of the Python programming language The primary focus is on developing best practices in writing Python and exploring the extensible and unique parts of the Python language Topics include Pythonic conventions data structures such as list comprehensions anonymous functions iterables powerful map filter zip and Python libraries For the last few weeks students will work with course staff to develop their own significant Python project Prerequisite CS106B CS106X or equivalent Terms Spr Units 2
