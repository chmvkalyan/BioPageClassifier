Playable Prototype Note Deliverables Homework 3 Interactive AudioVisual Music Sequencer NOTE this image is here mostly for its colors PLEASE DO NECESSARILY MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THIS timeline part 1 research design submit to Canvas and be prepared to present part 2 working be prepared to present part 3 playable prototype be prepared to present Almost inevitably at some point in one music software design journey you be to make a step sequencer In this assignment we are going to get that off our of our system and make a crazy software driven by some type of step sequencer Part 1 of 3 Research Preliminary Design due also upload to Canvas do research on music sequencers compile a list of useful references on various types of step sequencers designs articles papers images etc sketch your own preliminary designs of a step sequencer make 3 different designs maximally different from each other what features to include what does it look like linear circular spherical mobius a game a galaxy sequencing of pitch dynamics loundness envelopes how many parallel tracks layers or different types of sound track 1 synth track 2 drum etc how input the sequence in how does it sound will it use synthesis load audio samples MIDI can you sequences what file format should we have a common format how to tempo sketch as much as detail as possible even if you do end implementing them hand in scans of your paper designs and be ready to present on Monday scans of these design sketches can go onto your website for this project Part 2 of 3 Something Working IMPORTANT timing must be to ensure precision driven from not from have something working in software towards your core Check out the CHICKEN SEQUENCER tutorial video files from the tutorial NOTE this is mainly to show how to integrate timing as it is helpful but this is NOT meant to be starter code every sequencer may be quite different driving the timing of a repeating sound event from chuck having the time between sound events be variable and controlled from unity driving the animation corresponding to it from a value in chuck NOT a value in unity this is essential because chuck timing is much tighter than unity decide on a design set of features for a step sequencer the design decisions should account for the questions raised in part 1 above implement a working prototype of your step sequencer should use Chunity see chunity tutorials skip the setup step see chunity reference for complete documentation may wish to refer to Unity Execution Order may wish to refer to Unity Colliders Overview for which colliders interact with which colliders and how may wish to refer to Unity for programmatically instantiating a prefab see more here potential things to sequence pitch dynamics different timbres instruments envelopes requirements functional aesthetic goals must be graphical must be interactive must be musical should be flexible in usability should support some narrative complexity should feel satisfying to use hints think of design and design create an audio engine as well as a graphics engine how do they interact having a grid can be very useful but not strictly necessary Part 3 of 3 Playable Prototype given the short timeframe please aim for a playable prototype Musical Statement Presentation using your sequencer create a short musical statement create a short but polished video of a of your sequencer be prepared to present it in class create a webpage for your audiovisual sequencer which must contain one or more screenshot s your sequencer video your initial design sketches research motivate and articulate how you made your design decisions system design how is your software architected we recommend a class diagram optional any code for download Note As always have fun with it Make it satisfying you are welcome to work together but you must do your own work comment your code Deliverables a website containing 1 design sketches scan them in if necessary 2 a polished video of your step sequencer in action and your musical statement 3 screenshots of your step sequencer in action 4 optional source to the project 5 instructions on using your step sequencer 6 instructions on building the project for example anyone in the class should be able to download 7 readme section describing any comments you want to share difficulties and what you enjoyed on using Chunity 8 upload the website URL submit all necessary files code images videos etc to canvas default CCRMA webpage http Retrieved from https Navigation menu Views Page Discussion View source History Personal tools Log
