Arduino peripherals Large team project Android device and programming hardware required Limited enrollment Prerequisites ME210 ME218 or permission of instructor Last offered Spring 2017 ME 216M Introduction to the Design of Smart Products This course will focus on the technical mechatronic skills as well as the human factors and interaction design considerations required for the design of smart products and devices Students will learn techniques for rapid prototyping of smart devices best practices for physical interaction design fundamentals of affordances and signifiers and interaction across networked devices Students will be introduced to design guidelines for integrating electrical components such as PCBs into mechanical assemblies and consider the physical form of devices not just as enclosures but also as a central component of the smart product Prerequisites include CS106A E40 and ME 210 or ME218 highly recommended or instructor approval Terms Spr Units 4
