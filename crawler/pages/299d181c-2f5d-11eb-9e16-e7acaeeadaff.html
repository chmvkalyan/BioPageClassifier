courses LINGUIST 1 Introduction to Linguistics This course introduces students to the cognitive organization of linguistic structure and the social nature of language use We will investigate language as it is used in our everyday lives highlighting both the variability and systematic nature of all levels of linguistic structure In doing so we will discover how to approach language from a scientific perspective learn the fundamentals of linguistic analysis and understand the foundational concepts of the field of Linguistics Terms Aut Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Sumner PI Korat O TA Lamm TA Leigh TA LINGUIST 106 Introduction to Speech Perception Basics of acoustic phonetics and audition What do listeners perceive when they perceive speech Examine current research including the categorical perception of speech speech perception infant speech perception Theoretical questions of interest to speech perception researchers and experimental methods used in the field Last offered Spring 2011 Units 4 LINGUIST 110 Introduction to Phonology Introduction to the sound systems of the world languages their similarities and differences Theories that account for the tacit generalizations that govern the sound patterns of languages Terms Aut Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Podesva PI Gratton TA LINGUIST 121A The Syntax of English A introduction to the study of generative syntax through an investigation of the sentence structure of English Emphasis is on central aspects of English syntax but the principles of theory and analysis extend to the study of the syntax of other languages The course focuses on building up syntactic argumentation skills via the collective development of a partial formal theory of sentence structure which attempts to model native speaker knowledge Satisfies the WIM requirement for Linguistics and the requirement Prerequisites none can be taken before or after Linguistics 121B The discussion section is mandatory Terms

including but not limited to English Emphasis is on understanding how languages are systematically alike and different in their basic sentence structure The course focuses on building up syntactic argumentation skills via the collective development of a partial formal theory of sentence structure which attempts to model native speaker knowledge Satisfies the WIM requirement for Linguistics and

concepts and issues in the linguistic study of word meaning We explore grammatical regularities in word meaning and the relation between word meaning and the conceptual realm The questions we address include the following How is the meaning of a word determined from its internal structure How can simple words have complex meanings What is a possible word How does a meaning determine the word syntactic distribution and what kind of reasoning does it support What kind of information belongs to the lexical entry of a word The course will show that the investigation of the linguistic and semantic structure of words draws on the full resources of linguistic theory and methodology Prerequisites Linguist 1 or equivalent or permission of the instructor Linguist 130A is not a prerequisite for this course Terms Aut Units UG Reqs GER Instructors Condoravdi PI LINGUIST 140 Learning to Speak An introduction to child language acquisition None of us were born talking We all had to learn it How did we do that We start the journey by looking at the perception of sounds before birth We follow infants as they discover the sounds of their native languages We talk about how the infant mind breaks the speech stream into words phrases and sentences how it makes sense of language and uses it to convey thoughts and feelings We finish by discussing how the majority of children in the world learn two or more languages at once The course content will introduce you to major topics in child language acquisition Assignments will help you develop skills in collecting analyzing and reporting empirical data The class project involves collecting data from children at the Bing Nursery school on campus as well as the analysis of a large dataset of children speech online Class discussion and projects focus on giving you a experience with critical and scientific thinking Terms Spr Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Jasbi PI LINGUIST 145 Introduction to Psycholinguistics PSYCH 140 How do people do things with language How do we go from perceiving the acoustic waves that reach our ears to understanding that someone just announced the winner of the presidential election How do we go from a thought to spelling that thought out in a sentence How do babies learn language from scratch This course is a practical introduction to psycholinguistics the study of how humans learn represent comprehend and produce language The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of both the research methodologies used in psycholinguistic research and many of the findings in the field Topics covered will include visual and auditory recognition of words sentence comprehension reading discourse and inference sentence production language acquisition language in the brain and language disorders Students will conduct a small but original research project and gain experience with reporting and critiquing psycholinguistic research Terms Aut Units 4 Instructors Degen J PI
