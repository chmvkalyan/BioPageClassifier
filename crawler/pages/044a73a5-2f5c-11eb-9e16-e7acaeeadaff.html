Coding in Java Professional Certificate The need for qualified experts to support organizations in the development of secure software is now greater than ever To meet this growing demand we share solutions that are developed as part of our important research The most effective way for developers to improve software security is to eliminate vulnerabilities during the software is released to users We offer two certificates in secure coding Secure Coding in Java described here and Secure Coding in C and Both certificates can be earned entirely through online training Build More Secure Software The CERT Secure Coding in Java Professional Certificate helps software developers increase security and reduce vulnerabilities in the Java programs they develop It provides software developers with practical instruction based on the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java which was curated from the contributions of leading experts for the Java programming language The CERT Division has been extremely successful in developing secure coding standards which have been adopted at the corporate level by companies such as Cisco and Oracle The success of the secure coding standards contributed to the impetus for including software assurance requirements in the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 Our certificate program helps organizations train their teams to eliminate vulnerabilities during development which can result in reductions in the total cost of repairing code compared to making the repairs after development In two courses the CERT Secure Coding team teaches the essentials of designing and developing secure software in Java participants demonstrate their comprehension of the concepts in an examination Register for Certificate Now Benefits Who Should Get This Credential Term and Renewal Summary of Fees How to Earn the Certificate Benefits of the CERT Secure Coding in Java Certificate Completion of this professional certificate enables software developers to increase security and reduce vulnerability in the Java programs they develop Participants acquire a working knowledge of common programming errors that lead to software vulnerabilities how these errors can be exploited and effective mitigation strategies for preventing the introduction of these errors In particular participantslearn how to improve the overall security of any Java application avoid injection attacks such as SQL injection and XSS understand Java memory model and learn how to prevent race conditions while avoiding deadlock learn when to throw and catch exceptions avoid vulnerabilities including race conditions learn how historical exploits on Java were executed and later disabled After completing the certificate participants may choose to be listed on the SEI website as an SEI Certificate Holder Who Should Get This Credential Java developers in government and industry organizations who want to increase the security of their code and reduce its vulnerability to attack IT professionals who want to obtain a working knowledge of common programming errors that lead to software vulnerabilities how these errors can be exploited and effective mitigation strategies for preventing the introduction of these errors Term and Renewal The CERT Secure Coding in Java Professional Certificate does not expire Summary of Fees Participants pay fees for courses and the exam there is no additional fee for the certificate eLearning package Organizations considering this training for a group of participants can take advantage of eLearning group discounts or schedule a private onsite training delivery Email or telephone for details Certificate Process To earn this certificate complete the following courses and the exam within 12 months Classroom eLearning Onsite Secure Software Concepts Secure Coding in Java Secure Coding in Java Examination Download a PDF about this certificate Secure Software Concepts Secure Software Concepts explores basic security concepts and how security design principles protect the organization Risk assessment and management regulatory requirements and software design are examined within the context of the organization acquisition and development lifecycles to prepare the student for a deeper study of secure coding This eLearning course contains 2 hours of video instruction that may be studied incrementally Secure Coding in Java Secure Coding in Java provides detailed instruction about common programming errors in Java and describes how these errors can lead to code that is vulnerable to exploitation The course concentrates on security issues intrinsic to the Java programming languages and associated libraries This eLearning course contains 16 hours of video instruction which may be studied incrementally and 4 online exercises performed in the virtual lab environment Secure Coding in Java Examination The CERT Secure Coding in Java Professional Certificate concludes with an examination of the student comprehension of the concepts presented in the preceding courses The exam consists of 40 questions Students proceed through the exam at their convenience over 6 total hours Students must achieve a passing score of 80 Related Courses Secure Coding in Java 4 4 Day Course Network Software Security Producing secure programs requires secure designs However even the best designs can lead to insecure programs if developers are unaware of the many security pitfalls inherent in Java programming This course provides a detailed explanation of common programming errors in Java and describes how these errors can lead to code that is Register Training courses provided by the SEI are not academic courses for academic credit toward a degree Any
