Carol Woody PhD Rita Creel In this webcast Carol Woody and Rita Creel discuss how cybersecurity engineering knowledge methods and tools throughout the lifecycle of systems will reduce their inherent cyber risk and increase their operational cyber resilience Publisher Software Engineering Institute Subjects Cybersecurity EngineeringCybersecurity Engineering Watch Abstract When systems were predominately components were built to specification Systems engineers defined and verified component functions and interfaces that together provided total system capability Today system capability is largely supplied through software components and network connectivity This increases the system s flexibility and its cyber risk Software components are specified loosely if at all and are often assembled from an opaque mix of modified legacy components commercial COTS applications and services and open source libraries downloaded from the Internet This greatly increases the surface Using cybersecurity engineering knowledge methods and tools throughout the lifecycle of systems will reduce their inherent cyber risk and increase their operational cyber resilience What attendees will learn Cybersecurity engineering consolidates the tools and analyses used in various lifecycle steps to ensure effective operational results Cybersecurity engineering builds upon data that is scattered across lifecycle activities and products to identify gaps and potential mission impacts The Software Engineering Institute s Cybersecurity Engineering and Software Assurance Professional Certificate Program enables participants to understand identify and manage cybersecurity risks in developing or acquiring systems through activities such as threat modeling security engineering risk analysis and supply chain risk assessment About the Speaker Carol Woody PhD Carol Woody has been a senior member of the technical staff since 2001 Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security

Engineering CSE team whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cyber security in acquisition system and software engineering CSE is building capabilities in defining acquiring developing measuring managing and sustaining secure software for highly complex networked systems as well as systems of systems Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies higher education and medical organizations She has helped them identify effective security risk management solutions develop approaches to improve their ability to identify security and survivability requirements and field software and systems with greater assurance As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME a timekeeping application being developed for New York City She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system New York City Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state city and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement processes for managing social service payments As project manager at Yale University Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID card solution developed technical specifications and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package designed and implemented expert system technology for distributed data collection and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university Woody holds a PhD in information science from Nova Southeastern University an MBA from Wake Forest University and a BS in mathematics
