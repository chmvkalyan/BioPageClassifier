to improve Alan Perlis We have forgotten about Founders Day In lieu of a single event we will be announcing the winners of our faculty and staff awards in upcoming issues of SCS Today Nomination deadline is Friday May 22 Nominate The SCS Staff Recognition Awards seek to recognize staff for going above and beyond their assigned duties often crossing traditional positional or departmental boundaries The definitions below are intended to serve as guidelines for nominators to understand the perspective of the selection committee when it reviews the whole set of nominations No particular definition below will be used to limit or restrict eligibility of any particular nomination in a given category As noted in the nomination form the category ies selected by the nominator will be regarded by the committee as a suggestion The selection committee and the Dean reserve the right to move a particular nomination to a different category based on the comparison of that nomination with other nominations received in a given year In addition the Dean may from time to time create a new category to recognize a particularly unique contribution noted in a nomination Nominators planning to an individual should work together whenever possible to submit a single nomination Names of additional nominators can be included in the body of the nomination Nominate Your Colleagues Nominations are currently closed Founders Day Home Current Recipients Past Recipients Attention Nominators We intend to make the text of your nomination public via this website In the interest of space we are likely to edit most nominations Our default will be to include the name s of the nominator s with each nomination If you prefer not to have your name included please indicate this by checking the Anonymous Nomination option when submitting your nomination Process The full text of each nomination will be reviewed by one or more members of a selection committee The selection committee will include the Associate Dean for Finance and Administration plus three or more SCS staff members each of whom is a previous winner of a SCS Staff Recognition award After reviewing all of the nominations the committee will provide to the Dean two or more recommendations for each award and the Dean will make a final selection for each award Categories Rookie of the Year This award recognizes exceptional performance by an employee who has only been in the SCS environment for a short time We typically use one year as the definition of short time but that should not be viewed as a strict cutoff Sustained Excellence The award for sustained excellence is intended to recognize the exceptional performance of a staff member in SCS over the course of several years There is no minimum or maximum time period Generally the nominees in this category will be well known across much of SCS and will be seen as a go to person Individual Dedication Certain words and phrases come to mind as companions to dedication Persistent Reliable Loyal Though it is usually simple to distinguish between an employee who is dedicated and one who is not it is a challenge to compare two dedicated employees and conclude that one is more dedicated than the other Nominators are encouraged to write nominations in this category that focus on the remarkable result the impact to the department or the college of the dedication of the individual and not just the fact that is dedicated Outstanding Staff Our standards for staff performance in SCS are very high The award for outstanding staff is intended to recognize an individual whose performance has clearly exceeded our usual standard in some way Nominations in this category often include a story of some recent specific remarkable achievement but have also included more general descriptions of reliability and excellence Citizenship The award for Citizenship will generally be given to a SCS staff member who has demonstrated a broad concern for the whole SCS community Often this takes the form of working across department boundaries but sometimes a nominee is observed to be cheerfully and genuinely helpful beyond job duties to anyone with whom comes in contact Past selection committees have also taken note of nominees whose activities have a positive impact on the external perception of SCS taking care not to favor nominations of individuals whose job functions expose them to external constituencies more frequently Teamwork The award for teamwork is intended to recognize accomplishments which include cooperation across traditionally defined departments or positions The teamwork category will often result in recognition of teams of SCS staff doing exceptional work However nominations of individuals who have been successful at reaching across boundaries will be considered on an equal plane with those of teams Faculty Awards Alan Perlis Award for Imagination in Computer Science This award was established in
