global communities Lenore s research from her early work in model theory and differential fields logic and algebra to her work in developing a theory of computation and complexity over continuous domains mathematics and computer science has focused on merging seemingly unrelated areas The latter work with Felipe Cucker Mike Shub and Steve Smale forms a theoretical basis for scientific computation In 1990 she reported on this work at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Kyoto On the eve of Alan Turing s 100th birthday in June 2012 she was plenary speaker at the Turing Centenary Celebration at the University of Cambridge England showing how a little known to logicians and computer scientists paper of Turing s is fundamental to this theory Lenore is excited by her
