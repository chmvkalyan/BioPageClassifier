keep you informed about our latest work I would like to let you know about some recently published SEI technical reports and notes Three of these reports highlight the latest work of SEI technologists on insider threat in international contexts unintentional insider threats and attributes and mitigation strategies The last report provides the results of several exploratory research initiatives conducted by SEI staff in fiscal year 2012 This post includes a listing of each report author s and links where the published reports can be accessed on the SEI website Best Practices Against Insider Threats in All NationsBy Lori Flynn Carly Huth Randall Trzeciak and Palma technical note summarizes best practices to mitigate insider threats in international contexts explains their importance and provides for each an international policy perspective Download the PDF Unintentional Insider Threats A Foundational StudyBy CERT Insider Threat Team This report examines the problem of unintentional insider threat UIT by developing an operational definition of UIT which is a current or former employee contractor or business partner who has or had authorized access to an organization network system or data and who through action or inaction without malicious intent causes harm or substantially increases the probability of future serious harm to the confidentiality integrity or availability of the organization information or information systems The report also reviews relevant research to gain a better understanding of its causes and contributing factors provides examples of UIT cases and the frequencies of UIT occurrences across several categories and presents initial thinking on potential mitigation strategies and countermeasures This research topic has largely been unrecognized so a major goal of this study is to inform government and industry stakeholders about the problem and its potential causes and to guide investments toward the highest priority research and development requirements for countering the PDF Insider Threat Attributes and Mitigation StrategiesBy George SilowashMalicious insiders pose a threat to the confidentiality integrity and availability of an organization information Many organizations look for hardware and software solutions that address insider threats but are unsure of what characteristics to look for in a product This technical note presents seven common attributes of insider threat cases excluding espionage which were drawn from a database maintained by the insider threat team which is part of the Division The note maps the seven attributes to characteristics insider threat products should possess to detect prevent or mitigate the threat None of these attributes alone can identify a malicious insider instead each attribute is one of many data points that an organization should consider when implementing an insider threat the PDF Results of SEI Exploratory New Starts Projects FY 2012By Bjorn

and David Zubrow The SEI annually undertakes exploratory new starts LENS projects These projects serve to 1 support feasibility studies investigating whether further work by the SEI would be of potential benefit and 2 support further exploratory work to determine whether there is sufficient value in eventually funding the feasibility study work as an SEI initiative Projects are chosen based on their potential to mature transition software engineering practices develop information that will help in deciding whether further work is worth funding and set new directions for SEI work This report describes the LENS projects that were conducted during fiscal year 2012 October 2011 through September 2012 have highlighted previously in the SEI Blog including posts by Bjorn Andersson who
