Mathletics Mathletics About the Project Camp Activities Student and Parent Testimonies Employment Apply Now Meet Our Team Mathletics is funded by the National Science Foundation NSF and designed to immerse middle grades youth current 6th 7th 8th graders in the rapidly growing world of sports data analytics and build their knowledge of statistical concepts and the data science process The program is particularly focused on engaging African American and Latinx youth in an effort to deepen their STEM knowledge and introduce them to STEM fields Mathletics is a project with three components 1 Sports Data Analytic Saturdays which occur 4 8 times during the academic school year 2 Spring Summit which is a experience for participants and their families to see the student research projects and 3 a daily summer camp hosted at both the University of Maryland College Park UMCP and Coppin State University in Baltimore MD At UMCP the program is hosted under the Maryland Institute for Minority Achievement and Urban Education MIMAUE and the Center for Math Education in the College of Education at UMCP At Coppin State University the program is hosted under Mathematics and Computer Science department Activities are led by faculty from UMCP and Coppin local county teachers and undergraduate students majoring in a Science Technology Engineering or Mathematics STEM field Students not only learn practical skills such as how to collect data and perform statistical analysis of the data but also engage in an personal statistics project in a field of interest to them One camp hosted with 50 kids at each location UMCP and Coppin Each campus will expose their students to campus recreational activities athletic coaches and data collection Due to our University mandate we will not be hosting a Mathletic program this year summer through the academic year We are however planning a virtual program To get on our mailing list please email mimaue Camp dates July 13 July 30 Time Virtual Monday and Thursdays Applications are CLOSED This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No 1906736 Any opinions findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation Mini sports combine for students where students engage in various sporting events followed by performing statistical measurements on their times and measurements compared to other Mathletes Field trip to Washington Mystics basketball game where students collect statistical measurements of professional basketball players followed by comparison of their measurements to those taken by the professional statisticians of the teams playing Recreation time at the TerpZone in the Stamp Student Union on campus at UMCP including playing ping pong bowling and arcade games Golfing lessons at the University of Maryland Golf Course directly adjacent to campus Trip to UMCP basketball arena Xfinity Center Interactions and presentations from UMCP athletic coaches and faculty on the importance and use of mathematics in athletics and coaching Gather and analyze survey data from UMCP students at the Stamp Student Union Below are some of the past comments made by students who attended Mathletics This is the best camp I ve ever been to in my We learned about math statistics and I learned there are different ways to collect data and analyze There are different steps to collect data gather analyze explain shapes of There are two different types of data quantitative and qualitative Saw first hand how we can use Taught in a fun The distributions were new to me and I learned what type of graph is for different types of Below are some results from our survey to parents whose children attended Mathletics Almost all parents cited academic reasons such as increasing mathematical knowledge and confidence in mathematics as the most important reasons to let their children participate in the camp 100 would recommend Mathletics to parents with eligible students Since all the parents responded either strongly agree or agree to the statement My child seemed to have gained mathematical knowledge as a result of being in this camp it can be concluded that their main expectations were met by the camp More than half of the parents also thought that their children enjoyed learning statistical and mathematics concepts the most MATHLETICS WILL NOT BE HIRING FOR SUMMER 2020 Mathletics is looking for two Summer Mathletics Assistant instructors
