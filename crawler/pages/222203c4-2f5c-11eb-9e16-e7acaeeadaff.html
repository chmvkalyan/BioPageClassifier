Stanford Vis Group Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization We moved to Seattle We packed our bags and headed north to become the University of Washington Interactive Data Lab Come visit us home papers people video stanford vis group Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization Jeffrey Heer Michael Bostock Protovis running on an Android phone The image sequence shows a animated scale transition in a scatter plot abstract We investigate the design of declarative languages for constructing interactive visualizations By separating specification from execution declarative languages can simplify development enable unobtrusive optimization and support retargeting across platforms We describe the design of the Protovis specification language and its implementation within an programming language Java We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring a data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions To support deployment we introduce rendering and infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform letting designers retarget visualization specifications from desktop to mobile phone with reduced effort We also explore optimizations such as runtime compilation of visualization specifications parallelized execution and rendering We present benchmark studies measuring the performance gains provided by these optimizations and compare performance to existing visualization tools demonstrating scalability improvements exceeding an order of magnitude materials and links PDF KB BibTeX Citation citation Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization Jeffrey Heer Michael Bostock IEEE Trans Visualization Comp Graphics Proc InfoVis 2010 PDF KB Best Paper Honorable Mention rss stanford computer science
