Research Opportunities Research Opportunities Auditory Cognitive Neuroscience Lab Lori Holt lab is working to understand the perceptual cognitive and neurobiological basis of how we listen We use a combination of tools to tackle questions about how human listeners decode complex sounds like speech Ongoing research includes testing children in auditory learning tasks examining foreign language classroom learners electroencephalography EEG and functional magnetic resonance fMRI imaging of auditory cognition and computational modeling We are happy to welcome students who are responsible motivated and inherently curious Adventurous collaborative and adaptable personalities with a sense of humor will fit into our community well Students have the option to volunteer or to work for course credit Please note that a commitment is required and the first semester serves as a probationary period If you are interested in becoming a Research Assistant please contact our Laboratory Manager Christi Gomez In your email please include a description of your interests and what you hope to gain from a research experience The Auditory Lab The Auditory Lab with Laurie Heller research examines the human ability to use sound to understand what events are happening in the environment Our perceptual experiments address whether there are acoustic cues that reveal attributes of sound events We test discrimination of sounds labeling of sounds and even gestures We have also examined how this knowledge influences which brain regions are recruited during the perception of sound events Current questions are whether audition plays a significant role in the perception of events and how listeners can learn to extract the information that echoes contain in order to navigate Student Research Assistants Understanding of acoustics or perception is desirable and the willingness to learn to use Matlab Appropriate for students with an interest in Cognitive Psychology Cognitive Neuroscience HCI signal processing or audiology For Research Programmers experience in Matlab programming Unity is a plus Research assistants and programmers will be eligible to receive research credit If interested please email a resume to laurieheller Behavioral Health Research Lab Kasey Creswell s Behavioral Health Research Lab is currently running two studies that are exploring the ways that alcohol affects young adult drinkers and the underlying factors that may relate to drinking Our lab is looking for highly motivated and students who desire to get experience in the field of clinical psychology and learn valuable research skills Please note that research assistants are expected to commit to working 9 hours per week for at least two semesters with the option to volunteer or earn course credit If you are interested in getting involved in our lab please visit our website and complete the RA application or contact our lab manager Greta Lyons to learn more The Cognitive
