described below In summary all homeworks are due before class on the scheduled date homeworks can be turned in late for a penalty homeworks are individual no cheating The final project will be in groups In the homeworks for this course you will be creating a web page that uses html CSS and JavaScript It will pretend to sell HW 1 involves generating a web page from dynamic content In HW 2 you will create a separate webpage to investigate using input events to support clicking dragging and using multiple fingers to change size In HW 3 you will build a custom editor that supports both painting and drawing that takes advantage of the input events In HW 4 you will update your implementation from Homework 1 to use ReactJS and add a Shopping Cart page In HW 5 you will add support for Undo using Command Objects and in HW 6 you will connect your web page to a backend web service and a database Finally you will have a separate group Final Homework List The homeworks will involve significant coding in JavaScript Here are the preliminary descriptions All of these homeworks are individual so you will need to be able to do them on your own Number Start Due Description HW 1 Html

sign whatever forms are needed Note you will get much more out of the class if you do the assignments Late Policy Assignments are due before the beginning of class Eastern time on the specified day The idea is that you wo be motivated to skip class to finish your homework Homeworks are to be uploaded to Github and Canvas in the appropriate place in the format described by each homework page see instructions for homework1 If there is a problem uploading emailing the submission to me will timestamp your submission but please still upload as soon as you can A penalty of 5 points out of 100 will be immediately applied after the start time of class An additional 5 points will be subtracted for each additional day late including weekends and holidays Assignments can not be turned in more than 1 week late 7 days from due date later than this will result in a zero 0 on that assignment Diversity Statement It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course that students learning needs be addressed both in and out of class and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource strength and benefit It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity gender sexuality disability age socioeconomic status ethnicity race and culture Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups In addition if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events please let me know so that we can make arrangements for you Resources Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion csdi 412 268 2150 online anonymous reporting platform username tartans password plaid All reports will be acknowledged documented and a determination will be made regarding a course of action All experiences shared will be used to transform the campus climate to be more equitable and just Technology for Class Zoom As a fully remote class we will be using Zoom for all lectures The Zoom link will be the same for the whole semester and the link will be available on Canvas I will record the lectures using Zoom recording feature and will upload the videos to the Files section of Canvas in the Lecture Videos folder Note that except where noted otherwise recordings of course sessions are provided solely for educational use by students enrolled in the course and may not be distributed to any other person or posted on the internet without the express written permission of the course instructor Therefore links to the the class videos will only work for people in the class Please make sure that your Internet connection and equipment are set up to use Zoom and able to share audio and video during class meetings See this page from Computing Resources for information on the technology you are likely to need Let me know if there is a gap in your technology as soon as possible and we can see about finding solutions Sharing video In this course being able to see one another helps to facilitate a better learning environment and promote more engaging discussions Therefore our default will be to expect students to have their cameras on during lectures and discussions However I also completely understand there may be reasons students would not want to have their cameras on If you have any concerns about sharing your video please email me as soon as possible and we can discuss possible adjustments Note You may use a background image in your video if you wish just check in advance that this works with your device s and internet bandwidth Chrome browser We will be authoring html css JavaScript and React In order to avoid issues everyone is expected to use the Google Chrome browser for their development and testing This will work on both PCs and Macs and probably Linux https Code Editor I will use Visual Studio Code VSCode as my code editor and recommend you do too but it is not required if you prefer a different environment Let email know if you like something better VS Code is available free for both Windows and Mac and probably Linux https Touch screen that can run Chrome The homework about Handling Input will require that you run Chome on a touch screen since you will need to implement interactions Apple iOS iPhone or iPad devices or Android phones or tablets should work as well as laptops that have touch screens which can run regular Chrome for Mac or Windows If you do not have available to you such as device please let me know and we can probably find one you can borrow Accommodations for Students with Disabilities If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources I encourage you to contact them at access Amount of Work This is a 12 unit course As per university policy this means that this course is expected to take students 12 hours per week including class time Cheating Policy see also below No Cheating All regular homework assignments in this course are individual you are required to do them by yourself Final projects are group projects you must work with your partner s Each person must do their own work independently No copying anybody else work No copying answers from any other course assignments The midterm is individual no consulting discussing or copying from other people in the class With respect to example code you find on tutorial sites like or it is fine to copy and paste that into your code but remember you must edit it to meet the requirements of the specific assignments It is not OK to copy significant size blocks of code from existing websites ask the TA or professor if you have questions No copying from a previous version of this course Penalty for cheating a zero on the assignment and possibly other penalties as well DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR CHEATING OR PLAGIARISM While there is a disciplinary committee which handles serious disciplinary matters referred to it the responsibility for establishing disciplinary guidelines rests with each department Since the affiliation of this course is with the Interaction Institute HCII we will follow the set of rules established by that department The following are the rules to be applied uniformly by the HCII First cheating in any form is not permitted as an ethical or professional behavior and will not be tolerated Cheating includes but is not necessarily limited to The use of unauthorized materials including computer programs in preparation of an assignment or during an examination The submission or use of falsified data The submission of work that is not the student own use or close imitation of the language and thoughts of another author and the representation of them as one own original work See below The use of an during an examination Supplying unauthorized data to another student for the preparation of an assignment or during an examination Collaboration in the preparation of an assignment unless specifically required or allowed by the instructor will usually be viewed as cheating Each student therefore is responsible for understanding the policies of the instructor offering any course as they refer to the amount of help and collaboration permitted in preparation of assignments Should any student be found guilty of cheating on a quiz exam homework or project at minimum a zero grade will be recorded and then averaged in with the other grades should there be any for the term Depending on the circumstances and at the discretion of the instructor and the Department Head the student may be failed in the course and may be expelled from the University In any case the University will be notified of any case of cheating or plagiarism A repeated occurrence of cheating will be treated as an automatic failure R grade and expulsion from the University A subtler form of cheating arises in the form of plagiarism which is defined as passing off as one own the ideas or works of another Making use of reference material and failing to note either at all or properly the original source constitutes plagiarism When two or more people work together on an individual project and each then turns in individual report as though no collaboration was involved this also is plagiarism Simply rewriting another words or thoughts or rearranging another materials is in every sense plagiarism unless the student properly and completely references such material each and every time it is used and to the full extent of usage Should a case of plagiarism arise the initial responsibility for judging the seriousness of the offense will rest with the instructor If the instructor feels that the student was simply sloppy in referencing the material used and plagiarized a judgment of sloppy professionalism rather than cheating will be made The grade for the paper project or thesis will be lowered by at least one grade point On the other hand if the instructor feels that the student plagiarized flagrantly and intentionally meant to mislead the instructor into thinking that the work was the student own original work the grade for the report project or thesis will be recorded as zero It should be emphasized that any group collaboration that involves individual projects papers or theses should be carried out only with considerable discretion That is students are encouraged to discuss and collaborate among themselves on the various principles which are exposited in class or covered in the reading material etc but any group discussion or collaboration which involves any specifics of projects papers or theses should be avoided unless the ideas or efforts of others are properly noted Put differently when individual work and thinking is called for group thinking work is entirely inappropriate and is a form of plagiarism In any case of cheating or plagiarism the student may request a review of the decision by the department head who will then make the final decision for the department The student of course can appeal any faculty decision to the University Committee on Discipline In a case of flagrant cheating by a graduate student on a thesis the matter will be forwarded to the Disciplinary Committee for stronger action Additional resources Academic Disciplinary Actions process is available in The Word University Policy on Academic Integrity Take care of yourself This semester is unlike any other We are all under a lot of stress and uncertainty at this time Attending Zoom classes all day can take its toll on our mental health Make sure to move
