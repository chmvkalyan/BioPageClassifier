Katherine Flanigan who will join CEE s faculty this fall was attracted to the university thanks to its philosophical discussions surrounding the identity and role of the civil and environmental engineers in a changing world The growing needs of society are changing the ways in which we carry out research and train students to serve the common good she says CEE is one of the first programs to rigorously embrace these technological advancements in both its research and ANSYS HALL A Creative Epicenter Fully opened in October 2019 as part of the College of Engineering s larger maker ecosystem known as TechSpark ANSYS Hall is a great boon for CEE courses What I can do with students just got bigger says Jim Thompson who teaches the Civil Environmental Engineering Design capstone course Using AI to Detect Energy Waste Liu s decision to work in asset management was in service of improving the Artificial Intelligence AI software he had spent years developing with Burcu Akinci the Paul Christiano Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Associate Dean for Research That software now offered through Liu and Akinci s 2016 CEE spinoff LeanFM Technologies provides facilities managers with the means to analyze data collected from existing sensors to identify diagnose and eliminate energy waste in their building s HVAC systems due to faults LeanFM is a PropTech a company uses information technology for the real estate industry Farming Data Improving Production or Arvind Murali Mohan MS 10 PhD 13 the opportunity to use technology to help farmers compile previously siloed data into one central platform means the chance to help them even the playing field in an industry where so many inputs are beyond their control As a of a Silicon precision agriculture startup that helps farmers with field management and crop performance Mohan heads up research and development for the company New Integrated Degree Program Focus on Emerging Technologies This fall CEE launched a new integrated degree program with the School of Computer Science The Master of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering and Integrated Study in Computer Science was designed for civil and environmental engineers who are interested in learning more about emerging technologies The Climate Change Issue CEE Continues to Advance Solutions for the Challenges Ahead Part 1 Extreme storms increasing temperatures drier climate is changing and so must our infrastructure design construction and management Determining how to best adapt engineering practices in the face of these new climate patterns is a massive undertaking but our CEE faculty and students are rising to the challenge Alum Pingbo Tang Joins CEE as Associate Professor CEE is pleased to welcome Pingbo Tang as an Associate Professor Tang earned his PhD in CEE in 2009 Tang whose PhD dissertation explored the extraction of surveying goals from point clouds obtained from laser scanners to support bridge inspection previously taught at Arizona State University and Western Michigan University Destenie Nock Engineer for Social Good Joins CEE Faculty Destenie Nock has joined the departments of Engineering Public Policy EPP and Civil Environmental Engineering CEE this fall She will begin as a Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow in EPP with an appointment to CEE before starting as a assistant
