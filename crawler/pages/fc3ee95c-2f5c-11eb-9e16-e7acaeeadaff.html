become ubiquitous in our society with applications in search image understanding apps mapping medicine drones and cars Core to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification and object detection Recent developments in neural network approaches have greatly advanced the performance of these visual recognition systems This course is a deep dive into details of based deep learning methods for computer vision During this course students will learn to implement train and debug their own neural networks and gain a detailed understanding of research in computer vision We will cover learning algorithms neural network architectures and practical engineering tricks for training and networks for visual recognition tasks Prerequisites Proficiency in
