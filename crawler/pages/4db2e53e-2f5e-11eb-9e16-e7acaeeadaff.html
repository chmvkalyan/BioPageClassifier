Summary written by Jason Sadural jsadural comments and suggestions always welcomed purpose is to create a methodology to understanding the maximum threshold of individual musical tracks that move rythmically in space This research will eventually lead to the creation of an auditory canvas that we can distort perturb by stretching bending or even ripping The products developed in this

collected through a graphical user interface developed in http PD with http GEM Experiments will primarily be conducted in the http Listening Room Room Configuration and Hardware The experiments will be conducted in the listening room at CCRMA Stanford 8 speakers configured horizontally equally spaced 0 45 90 etc 4 speakers above configured spherically above and 4 spherically below at etc Tascam 3200 16 channel mixer Linux box Software The programming environment we will use for this project will be PD and http Spatialization will be accomplished through Vector Base Amplitude Panning http GUI created through GEM http Physical Modeling for PD http Experiment 1 a simple example with a sound moving around audio sphere according to the graphical user interface to check consistency For our sounds we will mainly use short bursts claps snaps etc We will use a modification of which is a sphere with a mass able to roll completely around the developed user interface is representative of the actual configuration of the listening room The gray cubes represent actual speaker location and configuration with respect to the listener in the absolute center of the purple sphere The solid blue spheres indicate individual output channels which can be moved anywhere in virtual space The user is able to zoom of the sphere as well as rotate to any perspective We will map the location of the sphere to the spherical position controls of We will test for the accuracy of ovserved position along different regions of the current working driver which enables the sound source to move completely along the sphere is VBAP inspired by http Ville Pulkki Initial tests and subject response have show VBAP to produce high accuracy with point source localization in accordance with the virtual space Further implementations involving http physical modeling for PD have been added to the interface such as a spring Tests have been done in which 9 point sources attached along a stretchy string move along the sphere in which the user purturbs it in with great results In Progress Ambisonics playback of sounds incorporating First Order http Ambisonics in order to create localization paths independent of purple sphere Software used for this implementation will be with http SuperCollider and the absolute position data will communicate with PD using http Open Sound Control controllers wireless accelerometer based sphere called http BRBI created by http Woon Seung Yeo will interact with interface over OSC Gestures such as rotation and shaking will be mapped accordingly with physical models implemented in the interface http The gloves of shaolin will be a tool in which the user will be able to purturb the auditory canvas and be able to send projectiles in virtual space that would sonically represent inhomogenieties it encouters along it path Source path designer a figure 8 path along the sphere will be able to stretch vertically or horizontally in real time Spatial cues incorporating doppler shiFt and virtual wall reflections and damping will be incorporated in accordance with experimentation design Psychoacoustic experimentation canvas design it is necessary to determine several auditory thresholds One is determining the physical limit a correlated and syncopated sound can be seperated in virtual space with the user still able to identify correlation Further discusions are needed in order to determine the types of sounds to be used For the moment we will assume the sound source to be confined to the sphere Psychoacoustic experimentation design is currently still at it most preliminary stages More to come Category Projects Latest revision as of 2 October 2007 Contents 1 Project Summary 2 GUI 3 Spatialization 4 Psychoacoustic experimentation

determine several auditory thresholds One is determining the physical limit a correlated and syncopated sound can be seperated in virtual space with the user still able to identify correlation Further
