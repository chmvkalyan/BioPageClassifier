DevOps processes or more general Agile methodologies we often encounter initial resistance When people learn a new tool or process productivity and enthusiasm consistently dip which is known as the implementation dip This dip should not be feared however but embraced In his book Leading in a Culture of Change Michael Fullan defines the implementation dip as a dip in performance and confidence as one encounters an Read More Malicious User Stories Rejection Criteria and the New Business Value February 5 2016 Blog Todd Waits Traditionally DevOps practitioners think of business value as simply measuring the difference between money earned and money spent In that line of thinking security is often relegated to a secondary goal because it fails to directly drive revenue The misguided goal is to deliver functionality at all costs even if it compromises the integrity of the system or data As Rob Joyce head of the National Security Agency Tailored Access Operations group mentions in his Read More Applying DevOps Principles in Incident Response September 18 2015 Blog Todd Waits By Todd WaitsProject Lead CERT Division DevOps principles focus on helping teams and organizations deliver business value as quickly and consistently as possible While the principles advocate for improving the coordination between development and operational teams they can be adapted for any number of domains The key components of DevOps we want to emulate across other domains are collaboration between project team roles infrastructure as code automation of tasks processes and workflows monitoring of applications Read More Three Challenges to Documentation for DevOps Teams August 7 2015 Blog Todd Waits Formal documentation such as source code documentation system requirements and design documentation or documentation for various user types is often completely ignored by development teams applying DevOps processes and philosophies to documentation can help alleviate this problem Software documentation tends to fall into several categories code requirement design system and user documentation One reason documentation is often ignored is that standard documentation tools and processes create an obstacle for development teams since the tools and Read More The Benefits of High Frequency Testing June 11 2015 Blog Todd Waits At a recent workshop we hosted a participant asked why the release frequency was so high in a DevOps environment When working with significant legacy applications release may be a type event and the prospect of releasing more frequently sends the engineering teams running for the hills More frequent releases are made possible by properly implementing risk mitigation processes including automated testing and deployment With these processes in place all stakeholders can be confident Read More Addressing the Detrimental Effects of Context Switching with DevOps March 5 2015 Blog Todd Waits In a computing system a context switch occurs when an operating system stores the state of an application thread before stopping the thread and restoring the state of a different previously stopped thread so its execution can resume The overhead incurred by a context switch managing the process of storing and restoring state negatively impacts operating system and application performance This blog post describes how DevOps ameliorates the negative impacts that context switching between projects Read More ChatOps in the DevOps Team January 29 2015 Blog Todd Waits In the post What is DevOps we define one of the benefits of DevOps as collaboration between project team roles Conversations between team members and the platform on which communication occurs can have a profound impact on that collaboration Poor or unused communication tools lead to miscommunication redundant efforts or faulty implementations On the other hand communication tools integrated with the development and operational infrastructures can speed up the delivery of business value to the Read More What is DevOps November 20 2014 Blog Todd Waits In a previous post we defined DevOps as ensuring collaboration and integration of operations and development teams through the shared goal of delivering business value Typically when we envision DevOps implemented in an organization we imagine a machine that automates infrastructure provisioning code testing application deployment Ultimately these practices are a result of applying DevOps methods and tools DevOps works for all sizes from a team of one to an enterprise organization Read More Contact the Author Todd
