Protovis A graphical toolkit for visualization Protovis Overview Examples Documentation Download Gallery Layout Streamgraphs Parallel Coordinates More examples Download MB A graphical approach to visualization Protovis Protovis composes custom views of data with simple marks such as bars and dots Unlike graphics libraries that quickly become tedious for visualization Protovis defines marks through dynamic properties that encode data allowing inheritance scales and layouts to simplify construction Protovis is free and provided under the BSD License It uses JavaScript and SVG for visualizations no plugin required though you will need a modern web browser Although programming experience is helpful Protovis is mostly declarative and designed to be learned by example Protovis is no longer under active development The final release of Protovis was MB The Protovis team is now developing a new visualization library with improved support for animation and interaction D3 builds on many of the concepts in Protovis for more details please read the introduction and browse the examples This project was led by Mike Bostock and Jeff Heer of the Stanford Visualization Group with significant help from Vadim Ogievetsky We welcome your comments and suggestions Updates June 28 2011 Protovis is no longer under active development We recommend switching to September 17 2010 Release is available on GitHub May 28 2010 ZOMG Release is finally available Enjoy the powerful new layouts and the variety of new examples in the gallery We ve also moved from SVN to Gitorious to make it easier for you to participate in development October 1 2009 Release is available including minor bug fixes We ve also spruced up the home page and examples gallery in anticipation of VisWeek 2009 September 19 2009 Release is available including major performance improvments bug fixes and handy utilities such as scales and layouts We ve also moved all the documentation to the wiki so that we can more easily keep it New tutorials examples and documentation are available and more is on the way July 16 2009 Release is available including lines of API documentation and numerous bug fixes April 9 2009 First release on Google Code Getting Started How does Protovis work Consider this bar chart which visually encodes an array of numbers with height var vis new 150 150 1 20 function d d 80 0 function 25 This blue bar is rendered once per number mapping the data to height using a little function d 80 Thus a mark represents a set of graphical elements that share data and visual encodings Although marks are simple by themselves you can combine them in interesting ways to make rich interactive visualizations To simplify construction Protovis supports panels and inheritance A panel is a container for replicating marks Inheritance lets you derive new marks from existing ones sharing some or all of the properties For example here we derive labels for a rule and bar var vis new 150 150 0 2 function d d 80 1 20 function d d 80 0 function 25 25 bottom The rule s label inherits the data and bottom property causing it to appear on the rule and render the value datum as text The bar s label uses the bottom anchor to tweak positioning so that the label is centered at the bottom of the bar Want to learn more Peruse our examples and documentation Copyright 2010 Stanford Visualization Group
