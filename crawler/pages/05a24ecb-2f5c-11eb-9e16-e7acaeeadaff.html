undertaken in fiscal year 2010 Publisher Software Engineering Institute Report Number DOI Digital Object Identifier Abstract The Software Engineering Institute SEI annually undertakes several independent research and development IRAD projects These projects serve to 1 support feasibility studies investigating whether further work by the SEI would be of potential benefit and 2 support further exploratory work to determine whether there is sufficient value in eventually funding the feasibility study work as an SEI initiative Projects are chosen based on their potential to mature transition software engineering practices develop information that will help in deciding whether further work is worth funding and set new directions for SEI work This report describes the IRAD
