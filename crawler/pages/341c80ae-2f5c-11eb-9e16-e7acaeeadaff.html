a person to be effective in any role their power needs to be understood In this episode Matt Abrahams sits down with Professor of Organizational Behavior Deborah Gruenfeld to discuss her new book

podcast produced by Stanford Graduate School of Business and hosted by Matt Abrahams Each episode provides concrete tools and techniques to help you hone and enhance your communication How to Communicate to Power Full TranscriptMatt Abrahams Hello I m Matt Abrahams and I teach Strategic Communication at Stanford Graduate School of Business Welcome to Think Fast Talk Smart The Podcast One of the crazy things in my life is how power applies I teach My students take notes They ask questions They respect some of the things that I say And then all of a sudden I come home and I don t get the same kind of treatment My kids don t listen politeness sometimes goes out the door My status and power feel very different at work and at home Power permeates all facets of our personal and professional lives Today I am so excited to be joined by Deb Gruenfeld who is the Joseph McDonald Professor of Organizational Behavior at the GSB Deb s research examines how people are transformed by the organizations and structures in which they work She teaches an incredibly popular class called Acting With Power and just released a book with the same name Acting With Power Why We Are More Powerful Than We Believe Since we re all at home these days Deb and I were able to catch up virtually Deb thanks so much for being here and congratulations on your new book I m reading it now and I m really enjoying it Deborah Gruenfeld Oh that s great Thanks for saying that And yeah I m very happy to be on the other side of the launch So cheers to that Matt Abrahams I can only imagine All right Hey let s get started I d like to start with a definitional question How do you define power And how does it play out in our relationships at work and at home Deborah Gruenfeld So power is one of those topics People think about it in a lot of different ways We make the mistake often of thinking that power is like a personal quality But power is actually a resource that comes out of our relationships and how we manage our relationships and it has to do with the extent to which relationship partners need one another So whenever people need one another they both have power in a relationship The person who needs the other less relative to vice versa has more power in the relationship So it really has to do with how much value we add in our relationships and how many alternatives our relationship partners have to working with us So you can see power coming from many different types of sources At work it comes from formal reporting relationships There s positional power When we re the boss we have the authority or the right to tell people what to do and people need us for raises and bonuses evaluations whatever it is But we see the same types of dynamics even in situations where there are no formal reporting relationships So in peers for example there are power differences One person will often need the other friend more at a particular time for a particular reason and so they ll find themselves in a relatively powerless position where maybe they have to work a little bit harder on the relationship than their partner does The same thing is true in marriages I m sorry to say but usually that question comes up Matt Abrahams Right Deborah Gruenfeld So we love the idea of equality in marriage but actually I think what we really find is that the way couples manage power differences is that they get to have power in different realms So you get to be the decider in certain realms and your spouse gets to be the decider in other realms And that s as close as we get to equality I think But again it just has to do with how eager we are to please others and let them have their way based on how much we need them Matt Abrahams I didn t know our conversation Deb was going to be more like therapy for me You took me back to high school and being part of different groups and then you took me into my relationship Deborah Gruenfeld I know Matt Abrahams Power has a lot of dynamics that can influence people I know you ve worked with actors to help explore the dynamics and manifestations of power Based on what you ve learned I m curious what power looks like in terms of nonverbal behavior and presence Deborah Gruenfeld Sure So I ll try to give you just a few words that maybe your listeners can remember when thinking about whether they re using their body in a way that projects power The first one is whether you re on the square whether you re facing someone directly with your weight evenly distributed on both legs as opposed to turned to the side with your head tilted maybe your weight on one hip Anything we do to take our body off the square so that we re not facing someone directly undermines how powerful we feel to our relationship partners So being square is one We sometimes talk about stillness and working on stillness A lot of us when we re anxious do a lot of things physically with our bodies that lets the energy kind of leak out in all different types of directions We fidget We groom ourselves We play with our hair One of the things you ll notice if you pay attention to people who have a lot of authority is they tend to be very still and focused in how they use their energy and stillness of the head is actually a very important one So you ll notice often when someone is very authoritative they speak in a way while they re keeping their head perfectly still I worked with some young company founders recently who told me that one of them had been coached to put on his headdress before going into a meeting as a way of practicing stillness and keeping his head perfectly still If you imagine yourself wearing a heavy headdress or a crown what you realize It keeps your body straight up and down but it also forces you to elongate your neck and keep your head relatively still So stillness is a good one Silence is another interesting one Speaking to fill the silence is a way of giving power away So being comfortable holding silence often is a good way of shifting the balance of power in your own direction We talk a lot about spreading out So we know that the way animals project power is to be physically expansive They keep their arms away from their body They keep their knees apart What I like to focus on to be more practical or professional and is thinking about things just keeping your chest open is very important Matt Abrahams Right Deborah Gruenfeld So it just conveys kind of a generosity and a lack of fear if you can keep your shoulders back and your chest open Matt Abrahams When I teach some of it sounds like it dovetails a lot of what you re s all about being big balanced still and slow is what it sounds like Deborah Gruenfeld Yes Absolutely yeah One other thing I ll this gets a little bit more into the realm of things that some people feel uncomfortable recognizing how we use space and what that conveys about power So one of the things if you watch and people interact you ll notice is that people kind of have the right to move into others social bubbles in a way that is not reciprocal So whenever we stand closer to someone move in on them physically touch them on the shoulder or touch their things even it s a of an aggressive way of behaving And when we back away from people and give them a lot of space it kind of conveys the opposite feeling and sense of power It s also interesting to just pay attention to an experiment with allowing your arms to lead your body So we do a lot of work on this in my at someone for example We saw a lot of this in the news in the last year or so with Nancy Pelosi Pointing at someone is a very aggressive and very intimidating thing to do Any time we use our arms to move in on someone else s space there s something a little bit threatening or intimidating about it It suggests that we re not ready to back off So it s interesting to experiment with trying to move into other people s space Matt Abrahams I think experimenting with all of these things is really critical to helping people see what can happen for them in terms of their power And a lot of people just act out of habit and don t actually try on some of these new things I know in the work you do and the classes you teach you have your students actually trying this and I think that s a great way to learn Deborah Gruenfeld Yeah Yeah it s fascinating and it s a little bit People say Oh it feels unnatural or It feels inauthentic until you do it Matt Abrahams Right Deborah Gruenfeld And then you realize Oh you know what There was a part of me that could do that actually Once you get yourself into the right head space and the right reason for doing it this is how we grow Matt Abrahams Right it s all about giving yourself permission to try that Thank you Deborah Gruenfeld Right Matt Abrahams Do you have some insights on language and power For example I notice a lot of what I call hedging language things like kind of sort of and I And to my mind this just reduces people s mojo Any thoughts on the actual words we use and how it relates to power Deborah Gruenfeld Yeah absolutely So one of the things that I ve learned from working with actors is that an authoritative way of speaking is to speak in complete sentences They re often not long sentences but they re sentences that have a clear beginning and a clear endpoint It s part of expressing yourself in a decisive authoritative way that doesn t leave things open for discussion The hedging that you re talking about are all verbal kind of tics or ways of showing people that we re not sure we re right and that we re open to being questioned or being challenged And it does undercut your mojo I think that that s true On the other hand I think there are situations where For example when you are actually the smartest person in the room in can be disarming in a positive way to express yourself with less certainty and less confidence and some sort of humility or sense that you may not have all the answers Matt Abrahams I think the key point that you just raised there is the purposefulness of them I think many people do them out of habit and they re not using them strategically But I think it s fascinating that they do provide a strategic opportunity in communication Deborah Gruenfeld That s right That s right Matt Abrahams Again a lot of what we do in the classes I teach is talk about transitioning habits into choices And this to me sounds like a clear choice people could make to help them rather than just invoking it out of habit Deborah Gruenfeld Yeah I think that s a great way to think about it Matt Abrahams So as we come to an end I ask all of the guests on this podcast the same three questions and I hope you re game to give me your answers for these Deborah Gruenfeld Yep absolutely Matt Abrahams All right So if you were to capture the best communication advice you ve ever received as a to title what would it be Deborah Gruenfeld All right let s see if I can remember how I got this down to five to seven words The Most Important Person in the Scene Is Never Matt Abrahams Oh I like that Oh give it a little bit more Deborah Gruenfeld Just to tell you what it means Matt Abrahams It s provocative Yes Deborah Gruenfeld Oh it s so great So it s something I heard a director say when she was working with two students who were practicing a conversation reading a script and were both feeling very and looking to her for direction about how they were supposed to say something and whether it sounded okay She said to one of them She said to both of them first she said Who is the most important person in this scene And they both were looking at each other and trying to figure it out Well she starts talking first but he actually has all the power And then she looked at them She looked at the guy and she said The most important person in this scene is her Move off Matt Abrahams Mm Deborah Gruenfeld The most important person in this scene is And then she looked at the woman and said Who is the most important person in this scene And the woman said Me And she said No The most important person in this scene is Matt Abrahams Right Deborah Gruenfeld Move off Do you know what I mean So to me it is the most useful thing you can do to be effective as a to learn to train your attention on the other person and to do everything you can to make the other person look good and feel smart and get something out of the interaction And the bonus of that is that where you don t have any mental resources to think about yourself there s no fear There s no anxiety There s no shame None of that stuff You don t even see the audience Matt Abrahams Right In all the strategic communication work that we do we talk a lot about being in service of your audience Deborah Gruenfeld Excellent Matt Abrahams It s about their need It s not about your need and that s echoed nicely Deborah Gruenfeld Yes Yeah Matt Abrahams So let me move on and ask you Question No 2 Who is a communicator that you admire And why Deborah Gruenfeld So my favorite communicator right now is Andrew Cuomo Matt Abrahams Mm Deborah Gruenfeld And the reason for that is because one of the things that I think is most important for leaders to understand in terms of owning their power and little bit goes back to the first question you asked about to recognize that as a leader and a person in a position of power your most important duty is to play your part in someone else s story Matt Abrahams Deborah Gruenfeld And I ve heard him say I just heard him say this Trevor Noah asked him the other day Why aren t you responding to the president in a way that conveys your irritation Why aren t you engaging in the fights with him When he s critical of you why don t you respond He said My feelings have nothing to do with how I show up and they should have nothing to do with how I show up I have a job to do and my job is to run the state of New York and to I don t remember the words that he used but the words I would use is to say his job is to be a base of security for other people And he embodies so many of those things If you watch his body language if you look at the way he speaks we don t actually need to know what he s saying And he doesn t even know that much A lot of times he doesn t have the answers Matt Abrahams Right Deborah Gruenfeld But the way he shows up every day on time in his uniform with the seal with the flags behind him with the experts around him and just speaks in this calm controlled reassuring way he s letting us know he s got this And in a time when there s a crisis and when there s chaos this is what we need from our leaders I just admire the way he s doing it To me it s a perfect example of Of course he s terrified like the rest of us He s had sick family members He s dealing with a nightmare in New York And it s interesting because I realize when I watch him he doesn t have the answers He doesn t know what the right thing to do is He has no more certainty than the rest of us about what s coming But the way he communicates makes us feel like we can relax and go about doing what we need to do because he s behaving like the person in charge So to me it s a perfect example of what it looks like to own your power and authority I am enjoying watching him and I m enjoying knowing that people from all over the world are watching him Not because they need to know what he s saying but because they need to see him doing what he s doing Matt Abrahams Right Right Deborah Gruenfeld He understands the theater of it and I think it s a great example of why the whole idea of acting and playing a role is important for using power well Matt Abrahams I like that phrase you used the theater of So much of our communication is that theater and many of us fixate on just one or two elements instead of the broader scene that s being played out So thank you for that Deborah Gruenfeld Sure Matt Abrahams Our final question What are the first three ingredients that go into a successful communication recipe Deborah Gruenfeld Social role is the first one knowing what part you re playing Matt Abrahams Deborah Gruenfeld Visual focus is the second one being able to focus visually on other people and the things that you re doing so that you re not watching yourself And the third one is generous Matt Abrahams Wow That was a great way to summarize the lessons that you ve taught all of us about power and how to embrace our power Deb thank you so much I really appreciate your insights and guidance today Deborah Gruenfeld My pleasure Matt So delighted you re interested and it s been great to talk with you about these things Matt Abrahams Thank you We can all benefit from thinking about and leveraging the power we have and the power we bring to our interactions with others Thank you Organizational Behavior Career Success Leadership Management Email Share thishttps up for more insights and ideas For
