Book Computing is evolving from applications to interactive graphical applications However most user interface software is still written using languages designed for writing or even batch applications such as Fortran Pascal C or Ada Researchers are investigating new approaches that may allow the next generation of computer programming languages to better support the creation of user interface software In addition user interface designers are increasingly realizing that it is important to provide a high degree of customization In many cases it would be ideal to allow end users to create their own applications In a sense this is what spreadsheets allow since they can be programmed by their users The success of spreadsheets shows that end users can learn to program and that environments that support programming can be successful At the SIGCHI conference in New Orleans in May 1991 twenty leaders of the field got together in a workshop to discuss the future of languages for programming user interface software and for programming These twenty were chosen from over 60 people who applied The goal of the workshop was to discuss what types of computer languages would be appropriate in the future and begin collaborations on creating these languages This book contains the results of those discussions First Chapter 1 presents an overview of the topic and a summary of previous work The first day of the workshop was spent with talks from the attendees Chapters 2 through 18 contain the written papers that accompanied their talks During the second day of the workshop we broke into three groups to discuss various issues in depth Chapters 19 through 21 report on the group results Naturally we discovered more issues than we resolved and Chapter 22 contains a summary of the issues that were raised We hope this will be seen as a challenge to future language designers In the user interface community this book should be of interest to creators of toolkits UIMSs and other user interface tools as well as people creating applications that want to provide customization In the programming language community language designers would find this book useful since future programmers will need to write modern user interfaces with their languages Table of Contents Preface Acknowledgements Workshop Participants Contributors 1 Introduction Brad Myers Part 1 Programming
