Sadural jsadural comments and suggestions always welcomed Our purpose is to explore the realm of computational physics and physical tendancies through acoustical perception In our inate desire to explore who we are and where we come from physicists have explored the cosmos as far as light and the age of the universe will allow for answers From data gathered at the furthest spectrum of the universe such as the Cosmic Microwave Background to relatively closer phenomena a standard model is devised in order for us to understand what we observe and why Through observational data from telescopes and satalites are systematically collected to confirm and converge to coefficients in our physical models as well as tendancies certian systems Computational Astrophysicists then recreate and simulate these systems in order to test the stability and consistency of these models Within this process we attempt to create meaningfull sonification techniques of these simulations in spatialized sound in order to better understand the physical tendancies not easily seen with current Visualization techniques Computational Astrophysics What is Computational Astrophysics Computational astrophysics is the simulation of astrophysical phenomena on a computer by numerical integration of the relevant governing equations Such simulations produce detailed solutions to highly complex problems in stellar evolution galactic dynamics numerical cosmology and many other fields Which simulations The simulation data we are going to use is from Laboratory for Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics at UCSD directed by Michael Norman Professor Norman was one of the first innovators to apply computational physics to simulate star formation from evolving over time the initail conditions of our universe Our goal is to develop meaningful sonification techniques and sonify phenomena through data mapping of simulation experiments done by his graduate student Dave Collins Later we hope to be able to adapt this technique to other simulations fundamental to our understanding of physics Links to simulations we hope to Sonify http Dave Collins current data http Mike Norman Simulation http Mike Norman Simulation Software currently used to create simulation data A or explicit Eulerian grid code for astrophysical radiation magnetohydrodynamics A or explicit

KRONOS A hydrodynamics cosmology code combining the piecewise parabolic method PPM with the PM algorithm for collisionless particles Enzo an adaptive mesh refinement AMR hybrid code hydro which is

particle on Silicon Graphics workstations LCA Vision The portable rewrite of 4D2 including support for adaptive mesh refinement data Another notable project that has many simulations we hope to sonify is the Athena Project This project has many simulations that are fundamental to understanding physics in our universe Computer Music Sonification Technique The software we will be using for sonification playback is Pure Data PD created by Miller Puckette currently Associate Director of the Center for Research in Computing and the Arts The core of the research will be conducted and developed in the listening room at CCRMA The current approach is to create a virtual environment where the listener is in a position or along a path in the simulation and in be able to explore the space sonically Many projects in parallel will be developed with the intention of sonifying data Links to projects Spatial layers Gloves of Shaolin Data Transposition In the first approach in linking simulation data with usable data to current computer music tools we will be using a 2D slice of the 3D simulation The 2d slice in jpg format will be analyzed by Raster Scanning developed by Woon Seung
