President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 3 of 3 results for CS 230 Deep Learning printer friendly page CS 230 Deep Learning Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills in AI We will help you become good at Deep Learning In this course you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning understand how to build neural networks and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects You will learn about Convolutional networks RNNs LSTM Adam Dropout BatchNorm initialization and more You will work on case studies from healthcare autonomous driving sign language reading music generation and natural language processing You will master not only the theory but also see how it is applied in industry You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow which we will teach AI is transforming multiple industries After this course you will likely find creative ways to apply it to your work This class is taught in the format You will watch videos and complete programming assignments and online quizzes at home then come in to class for advanced discussions and work on projects This class will culminate in an final project which the teaching team will help you on Prerequisites Familiarity with programming in Python and Linear Algebra matrix vector multiplications CS 229 may be taken concurrently Terms Aut Win Spr Units UG Reqs
