process and organizational structures to promote business value software quality attributes most important to your organization continuous improvement As I have discussed in previous posts on DevOps at Amazon and software quality in DevOps while DevOps is often approached through practices such as Agile development automation and continuous delivery the spirit of DevOps can be applied in many ways In this blog post I Read More Continuous Integration in DevOps April 8 2015 Blog Aaron Cois When Agile software development models were first envisioned a core tenet was to iterate more quickly on software changes and determine the correct path via exploration essentially striving to fail fast and iterate to correctness as a fundamental project goal The reason for this process was a belief that developers lacked the necessary information to correctly define project requirements at the onset of a project due to an inadequate understanding of the customer and an Read More DevOps Case Study Amazon AWS February 5 2015 Blog Aaron Cois Regular readers of this blog will recognize a recurring theme in this series DevOps is fundamentally about reinforcing desired quality attributes through carefully constructed organizational process communication and workflow When teaching software engineering to graduate students in Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College I often spend time discussing well known tech companies and their techniques for managing software engineering and sustainment These discussions serve as valuable examples for software engineering approaches and associated outcomes and Read More Continuous Integration in DevOps January 26 2015 Blog Aaron Cois When Agile software development models were first envisioned a core tenet was to iterate more quickly

feel like a superhuman feat So how can you start your organization on the path to DevOps without compromising your existing business goals and Read More DevOps and Agile November 13 2014 Blog Aaron Cois Melvin Conway an eminent computer scientist and programmer created Conway Law which states Organizations that design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations Thus a company with frontend backend and database teams might lean heavily towards architectures The structure of the application developed will be determined in large part by the communication structure of the organization developing it In short form is a product of Read More DevOps Enhances Software Quality November 6 2014 Blog Aaron Cois A DevOps approach must be specifically tailored to an organization team and project to reflect the business needs of the organization and the goals of the project Software developers focus on topics such as programming architecture and implementation of product features The operations team conversely focuses on hosting deployment and system sustainment All professionals naturally consider their area of expertise first and foremost when discussing a topic For example when discussing a new feature a Read More A New Weekly Blog Series to Help Organizations Adopt Implement DevOps November 3 2014 Blog Aaron Cois DevOps is a software development approach that brings development and operations staff IT together The approach unites previously siloed organizations that tend to cooperate only when their interests converge resulting in an inefficient and expensive struggle to release a product DevOps is exactly what the founders of the Agile Manifesto envisioned a nimble streamlined process for developing and deploying software while continuously integrating feedback and new requirements Since 2011 the number of organizations adopting DevOps Read More A Generalized Model for Automated DevOps June 2 2014 Blog Aaron Cois To maintain a competitive edge software organizations should be early adopters of innovation To achieve this edge organizations from Flickr and IBM to small tech startups are increasingly adopting an environment of deep collaboration between development and operations DevOps teams and technologies which historically have been two disjointed groups responsible for information technology development The value of DevOps can be illustrated as an innovation and delivery lifecycle with a continuous feedback loop to learn and Read More An Introduction to DevOps March 17 2014 Blog Aaron Cois At Flickr the and website the live software platform is updated at least 10 times a day Flickr accomplishes this through an automated testing cycle that includes comprehensive unit testing and integration testing at all levels of the software stack in a realistic staging environment If the code passes it is then tagged released built and pushed into production Read More
