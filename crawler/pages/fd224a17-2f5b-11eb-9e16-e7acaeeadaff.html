router writes updates into a log file There are many programs out there for parsing these files but I going to talk about a new program created at the CERT Division for searching the files The program is designed to find routes that affect a given set of CIDR blocks and to do it quickly Read More E Pluribus Que Identifying Vulnerability Disclosure Stakeholders November 5 2015 Blog Allen Householder On September 29 Art Manion and I attended the first meeting of the Multistakeholder Process for Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities initiated by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA part of the United States Department of Commerce There has been ample coverage of the meeting in blogs by Neal Krawetz and by Cris Thomas mailing lists and media reports so I wo attempt to duplicate that information During the course of the meeting I became Read More Supporting the Android Ecosystem October 19 2015 Blog Will Dormann A few months ago a set of vulnerabilities called StageFright hit the Android ecosystem While Google fixed the vulnerabilities in what appears to be a reasonable amount of time the deployment of those fixes to devices is another story Many Android devices have a lengthy supply chain which can make the process of deploying OS updates a slow and uncertain process In this blog post I investigate the supply chain of the Android Read More CVSS and the Internet of Things September 2 2015 Blog Dan Klinedinst There has been a lot of press recently about security in Internet of Things IoT devices and other computing environments Many of the most talked about presentations at this year Black Hat and DefCon events were about hacking IoT devices At the we coordinate information about and discover vulnerabilities in various devices and the number of vulnerabilities keeps growing One thing that I personally been researching is finding vulnerabilities in vehicles In recent Read More Recent Conference Presentations by the Vulnerability Analysis Team August 20 2015 Blog Allen Householder A number of us on the Vulnerability Analysis team have been out and about giving talks at various conferences recently This post provides links to the presentation slides related blog posts and the videos where available Read More Instant KARMA Might Still Get You August 11 2015 Blog Will Dormann About a year ago I started looking into Android applications that are validating SSL certificates Users of these applications could be at risk if they fall victim to a MITM attack Earlier this year I also wrote about the risks of MITM attacks on environments that use SSL inspection Lately I been checking whether IOS applications are consistently checking SSL certificates and they appear to be pretty similar to Android applications in that regard Read More Reach Out and Mail Someone August 6 2015 Blog Garret Wassermann Every day we receive reports from various security professionals researchers hobbyists and even software vendors regarding interesting vulnerabilities that they discovered in software Vulnerability coordination where we serve as intermediary between researcher and vendor to share information get vulnerabilities fixed and get those fixes out in the public eye is a free service we provide to the world Read More Comments on BIS Wassenaar Proposed Rule July 22 2015 Blog Allen Householder Art Manion and I recently submitted comments to the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security on their proposed rule regarding Wassenaar Arrangement 2013 Plenary Agreements Implementation Intrusion and Surveillance Items While our detailed comments are lengthy we summarize our contributions here Read More The Risks of Disabling the Windows UAC July 13 2015 Blog Will Dormann While investigating a few of the exploits associated with the recent HackingTeam compromise I realized an aspect of the Windows User Account Control UAC that might not be widely known Microsoft has published documents that indicate that the UAC is not a security boundary For these or other reasons some folks may have disabled the UAC on their Windows systems I will explain in this blog post why disabling the UAC is a bad idea Read More Like Nailing Jelly to the Wall Difficulties in Defining Exploit July 7 2015 Blog Allen Householder During the Watergate hearings Senator Howard Baker asked John Dean a question My primary thesis is still What did the president know and when did he know it If you understand why that question was important you have some sense as to why I am very concerned that exploit capability appears as an operative phrase in the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security BIS proposed rules to implement the Wassenaar Arrangement Read More YAF App Label Signature Context with Analysis Pipeline June 19 2015 Blog Angela Horneman In my last post I presented how to create a YAF application label signature rule that corresponds to a rule In this post I discuss methods for using Analysis Pipeline to provide context to those signatures The context for signatures can take many forms Some context can be derived from the individual flows that match the signatures This information is easy to obtain from either SiLK or another traffic analysis tool just look at Read More Domain Blacklist Ecosystem A Case Study June 18 2015 Blog Jonathan Spring Hi all this is Jonathan Spring with my colleagues Leigh Metcalf and Rhiannon Weaver We been studying the dynamics of the Internet blacklist ecosystem for a few years now and the 2015 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report has corroborated our general results We get a lot of questions about which list is which and if we can recommend a list We wo reveal which is which generally but in this blog post we make a Read More Making YAF App Labels from Snort Rules June 12 2015 Blog Angela Horneman Ever want to use a rule with SiLK or Analysis Pipeline to find text within packets Timur Snoke and I were recently discussing how we could do this and realized that while neither SiLK nor Analysis Pipeline themselves do packet inspection YAF can be used to create an application label that can be used in analyses in both SiLK and Pipeline field 29 application This post outlines the steps required and provides an example Read More Baseline Network Flow Examples March 20 2015 Blog Angela Horneman Hi This is Angela Horneman of the SEI Situational Awareness team I generated service specific network flows to use as baseline examples for network analysis and am sharing them since others may find them helpful We have been looking at implementing Network Profiling in Analysis Pipeline to automatically generate lists of active servers and to alert when new IPs start acting as servers As part of this initiative we started looking at alternatives to using Read More The Risks of SSL Inspection March 13 2015 Blog Will Dormann Recently SuperFish and PrivDog have received some attention because of the risks that they both introduced to customers because of implementation flaws Looking closer into these types of applications with my trusty CERT Tapioca VM at hand I come to realize a few things In this blog post I will explain The capabilities of SSL and TLS are not well understood by many SSL inspection is much more widespread than I suspected Many applications that Read More Blacklist Ecosystem Analysis January 7 2015 Blog Jonathan Spring Hi all Leigh Metcalf and I have been continuing our study of the cybersecurity ecosystem Last year we published a long white paper telling you everything you wanted to know about blacklists Turns out that did not save the Internet on its own We extending that analysis with more blacklist ecosystem analysis this year Read More What Different About Vulnerability Analysis and Discovery in Emerging Networked Systems January 6 2015 Blog Allen Householder Hi folks Allen Householder here In my previous post I introduced our recent work in surveying vulnerability discovery for emerging networked systems ENS In this post I continue with our findings from this effort and look at the differences between ENS and traditional computing in the context of vulnerability discovery analysis and disclosure Read More New Technical Report Discusses the Regional Use of Social Networking Tools January 5 2015 Blog Kate Meeuf Hello this is Kate Meeuf of the SEI Situational
