course is a practical introduction to psycholinguistics the study of how humans learn represent comprehend and produce language The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of both the research methodologies used in psycholinguistic research and many of the findings in the field Topics covered will include visual and auditory recognition of words sentence comprehension reading discourse and inference sentence production language acquisition language in the brain and language disorders Students will conduct a small but original research project and gain experience with reporting and critiquing psycholinguistic research Terms Aut Units 4 Instructors Degen J PI LINGUIST 160 Introduction to Language Change Principles of historical linguistics the nature of language
