areas security requirements software supply chain assurance mission thread analysis and measurement The purpose of this course is to expose managers engineers and acquirers to concepts and resources available now for their use to address software security assurance across the acquisition and development life cycles The introduction establishes the importance of focusing on software assurance within the current development and acquisition environment Assurance methods relevant to each of the four critical software assurance areas are presented and participants are encouraged to discuss ways that adoption into the existing acquisition and development life cycles would improve their organizational software assurance Audience The target audience includes software managers and technical leads software and lead engineers software and system acquisition experts and management who are concerned with software security assurance across the acquisition and development life cycles Objectives Attendees will understand the challenges of software assurance Attendees will be exposed to key concepts and methods for security risk analysis and measurement security requirements elicitation mission thread analysis supply chain risk analysis Attendees will begin planning how they will address software assurance for acquisition and development programs Attendees will understand the best practices that can be implemented for software assurance Topics Introduction to the value of software assurance for development and acquisition Mission thread analysis and the use of the Survivability Analysis Framework to apply assurance to mission threads Supply chain risk management and its role in software assurance Security requirements overview of the course Security
