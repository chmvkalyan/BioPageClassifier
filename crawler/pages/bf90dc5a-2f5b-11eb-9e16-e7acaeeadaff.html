Housing Dining The extraordinary times of living through a pandemic call for our heightened commitment to prioritizing our community s health and safety as we work to mitigate coronavirus spread in our facilities and on campus As a result residential living will look quite different in the year ahead and it will take a shared commitment from all students and staff to ensure we can maintain open facilities to support education for as many of you as we are able to safely accommodate LIMITing HOUSING CAPACITY We are all of our housing facilities so that we will have no more than one student per bedroom and no more than three students per bathroom fixture set With the addition of some hotel rooms this approach will allow us to maintain 50 of our usual occupancy for the coming year For all students and upperclass students with existing housing assignments we will provide you an opportunity to live on campus for one semester in the year ahead and only a very small number of students with special circumstances will be provided housing for both semesters This is the most equitable approach to assigning our limited housing capacity ENCOURAGING REMOTE STUDY We strongly encourage students and families who can reasonably and safely consider remote study from home for the academic year to do so which will allow more capacity for those who are in need of housing The requirement that students live in university housing is waived for the upcoming academic year LIVING ON CAMPUS The university is implementing a required modified quarantine period that every student coming from outside Southwestern Pennsylvania SWPA must complete prior to joining coursework or engaging in other experiences Learn more about the modified quarantine period for students living on campus Please
