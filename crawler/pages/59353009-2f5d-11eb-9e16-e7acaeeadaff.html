From early church architecture through modern housing windows are passages of energy and matter in the forms of light sound and air By letting in heat during the summer and releasing it in winter windows can place huge demands on air conditioning and heating systems thereby increasing energy consumption and raising greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere Latest advances in materials science have enabled precise and control of electromagnetic radiation through dynamic windows with photochromic and electrochromic materials that change color and optical density in response to light radiance and electrical potential In this course we will spend the whole quarter on a project to make and characterize dynamic windows based on one of the electrochromic material systems the reversible electroplating of metal alloys There will be an emphasis in this course on characterization methods such as scanning electron microscopy photoelectron spectroscopy optical spec more From early church
