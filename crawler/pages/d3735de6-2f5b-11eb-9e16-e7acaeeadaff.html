Friday Shawn By Renee Madrigal As an anthropologist Shawn studies people however her love for culture language and people stretches far beyond the work hours of her Carnegie Mellon classes In her life outside of class Professor Shawn spends time with her family oftentimes still teaching Since first grade she has been fascinated by origami and has since passed down her love for the art to her son They even teamed up to start an origami club at his school where she teaches his classmates that any child can do She finds it a little funny that the young kids tend to engineer unique geographical shapes while she herself is more drawn to create animals She excitedly revealed her most beloved creation My favorite favorite favorite piece of origami is an Thanks to modern technology and sites like Youtube she explains you can slow the process down and see exactly how to do the folds I looked it up and I love to make these little tiny elephants and hold them in my don t know why but I just

going to get up and dance Every single Whether on the dance floor or in the classroom Professor exudes enthusiasm and charisma She laughingly considers herself to be geeky and longs for the chance to participate in activities for TV and book series naming Harry Potter Star Trek and The Hunger Games as top choices Like all anthropologists Professor is a true practitioner of participant observation she immerses herself in the culture she inhabits even if she and her friends are the ones creating that world like in the fascinating and strategic board game The Settlers of Catan Though she is not an avid gamer she is thoroughly excited by the prospect of playing games with friends and family I don t play games very frequently but when I get to do it WOW I love When talking about her life and her hobbies love is a word Professor uses frequently She is genuinely eager to try and experience new things participating fully in the moment She rarely finds something she does not enjoy The combination of patience curiosity and a let s do it attitude make her tireless and passionate as she moves among activities and cultures FacultyFriday Professor Shawn is an adjunct professor at
