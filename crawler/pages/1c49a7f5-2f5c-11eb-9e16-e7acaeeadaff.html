Technical StaffCERT Cyber Security Solutions Directorate In the realm of DevOps automation often takes the spotlight but nothing is more ubiquitous than the monitoring There is value to increased awareness during each stage of the delivery pipeline However perhaps more than any other aspect of DevOps the act of monitoring raises the question Yes but what do we monitor There are numerous aspects of a project you may want to keep an eye on and dozens of tools from which to choose This blog post explores what DevOps monitoring means and how it can be applied effectively Before getting into the state of monitoring in DevOps I want to take a minute to discuss tooling Because there are so many products trying to promote monitoring choosing among them can be distracting It is best to first understand what holds business value to you and your customers You should also recognize that not everything that can be monitored should be monitored Discussing any particular tool is the aim of this post but it is worth noting that the most vendors offer free trials and many other products are simply free so it might be worth your time to sample a few after you have determined your monitoring strategy Infrastructure and service monitoring have been around long before DevOps so how does DevOps really affect monitoring strategy and is DevOps even needed for monitoring Strangely yes in a way While monitoring predates DevOps DevOps has furthered the software development process to such a degree that monitoring ca help but evolve as well As a community we are beyond writing cool application code we are now writing cool infrastructure as code automating integration and testing and deploying everything in the cloud Generally the pace of development has increased which imposes greater load on the customer feedback loop and deployment tooling There is more to monitor so where we use tooling to automate integration testing provisioning and deployment we need to use tooling to monitor our builds resources and performance Primary Categories of Monitoring Targets Monitoring targets fall into several primary categories and you will likely want to cover at least one aspect of each category Broadly these categories are application log output server health development milestones vulnerabilities deployments and user activity I will cover each briefly below Development Milestones Monitoring development milestones is a great way to gain insight into your actual process and how effectively your team is operating This monitoring is really an indicator of how well your DevOps adoption strategy is working Look at how often your sprint scope changes the rate at which bugs are filed and fixed and the ratio of features Related to these metrics are the drivers that either encourage your team to work harder or demotivate and otherwise throw your schedule off the track Many issue trackers have this monitoring or provide an Agile plugin that helps to highlight this kind of data so there is no need to add Yet Another Dependency to your project But the reporting is sometimes easy to overlook and hard to interpret There is a lot of data and the charts do not answer obvious questions so it is well worth starting with the questions you want to answer such as What drivers caused us to miss 20 percent of our deadlines last year and work backward from there Vulnerabilities Monitoring vulnerabilities comes in two parts There are known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in application code lists of which are maintained at locations such as the National Vulnerability Database NVD and then there are vulnerabilities induced in the code of an application by insecure coding practices These may look the same but they differ in how they can be addressed changing dependencies educating your development team conducting regular code reviews or hiring better skills and how they can be identified NVD queries static code analysis This is a large topic outside the scope of this post but not to be avoided Deployments Deployment monitoring is sometimes as straightforward as configuring your build servers to notify the team or a designated team member that something is wrong These notifications are cheap they are easy to set up but very important so it pays to have this process fail loudly Chances are if you are already using DevOps you already have some monitoring built in to your process Many continuous integration servers are and can communicate with chat servers to alert teams of failed builds and deployments Application log output Application log output might be one of the most easily underestimated types of monitoring because by its nature running code already has output Consequently it is tempting to call it done on delivery But if your services are distributed and centralized logging is in place you are not getting the full benefit Moreover errors and exceptions lose a lot of their value if they are not received in It is also worth making sure that any code generates notifications and those notifications persist in a searchable format The ability to trace an exception in a production environment to a commit tag is a great bonus Server Health Server health may be the most obvious type of monitoring Here of course I am referring to uptime and performance with respect to available resources as opposed to application code inefficiencies Intrusion detection is also worth mentioning in this category because your response team is likely the same for both a downed or server as it is for a compromised server Intrusion detection is not often a direct feature of popular tools such as Nagios or what you would get out of the box from a cloud provider but it may make sense to have both intrusion detection and health monitoring systems on the same notification pipeline Activity Monitoring Lastly and most innocuous is user activity monitoring Output here can be used to drive both feature development and the scaling of infrastructure So much like monitoring development milestones it helps to approach this volume of data with prepared questions One final note about logging whether about application logs user activity monitoring or simply project history logging has even more value if the storage is centralized Any problems with the application can be detected and analyzed in a global context and if problems are well annotated different log sources can be correlated to learn even more about the state of the application and the project Wrapping Up and Looking Ahead While one area of monitoring may be more important to your business case than another it is hard to make an argument for ignoring any one area Some of these areas of monitoring are built into popular tools such as issue trackers and integration servers while others must be deliberately included But incorporating some minimal implementation of each kind of monitoring in your DevOps strategy will get you well on your way toward a more complete implementation of DevOps and a more stable and reliable infrastructure product and process The DevOps blog offers technical guidelines and practical advice for DevOps
