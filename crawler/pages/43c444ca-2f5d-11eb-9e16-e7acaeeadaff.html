PI Harris GP Joshi TA Pagon B TA Wuollet TA CS 342 Building for Digital Health MED 253 This course will provide a comprehensive overview of key requirements in the design and implementation of a digital health research application Several and approved projects from the Stanford School of Medicine will be available for students to select from and build Student teams learn about all necessary approval processes to deploy a digital health solution data privacy RB approval etc and be guided in the development of and infrastructure using best practices The final project will be the presentation and deployment of a fully approved digital health research application CS106A CS106B Recommended CS142 CS47 CS110 Limited enrollment for this course Last offered Autumn 2019 Units 3 CS 349G Selected Reading of Dissertations Detailed reading of 5 selected dissertations within a field of computer science For undergraduates the course is an introduction to advanced foundational concepts within a field as well as an look at detailed research For graduate students the course focuses on historical reading as well as an opportunity to read dissertations and discuss their strengths and weaknesses Both groups of students discuss historical context how ideas succeeded or did not and why and how they manifest in modern technology The discussion of each dissertation completes with a guest lecture by its author The selected dissertations change with each offering but are always from a coherent time period and topic area Prerequisites CS110 for undergraduates EE282 for graduate students Terms Win Units 3 Repeatable 10 times up to 30 units total Instructors Hennessy J PI Levis PI CS 349T Project Lab Video and Audio Technology for Live Theater in the Age of COVID EE 192T This class is part of a collaboration between researchers in the CS EE and TAPS departments to design and develop a system to host a live theatrical production that will take place over the Internet in the winter quarter The performing arts have been greatly affected by a transition to theater over Zoom and its competitors none of which are great at delivering audio to actors or audio and video to the audience or feedback from the audience back to actors These are big technical challenges During the fall we build a system that improves on current systems in certain areas audio quality and latency over spotty Internet connections video quality and realistic composited scenes with multiple actors audience feedback and perhaps digital puppetry Students will learn to be part of a software development effort working to meet the needs of a theater director and creative specialists while communicating the effect of resource limits and constraints to a nontechnical audience This is an experimental laboratory class and our direction may shift as the creative needs of the theatrical production evolve Based on the success of class projects and subsequent needs some students may be invited to continue in the winter term with a research appointment for pay or credit to operate the system you have built and instruct actors and creative professionals how to work with the system through rehearsals and the final performance before spring break Prerequisites CS110 or EE102A Recommended familiarity with Linux and Git Terms Aut Units 3 Instructors Fouladi PI Rau PI Weissman PI
