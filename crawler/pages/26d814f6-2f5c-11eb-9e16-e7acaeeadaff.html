UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Society of Women Engineers The Stanford Society of Women Engineers chapter was founded in 1986 with the following mission Promote the study of engineering and engineering fundamentals to our local youth through outreach work Provide career and academic development opportunities for our collegiate members Enhance the diversity of the Stanford engineering community Girls Teaching Girls to Code Girls Teaching Girls to Code is a program where Stanford women teach and inspire Bay Area high school girls to explore Computer Science and Engineering Students learn coding basics build exciting projects and develop strong relationships with mentors in the field Contact jduan1 at stanford dot edu Code the Change Code the Change helps computer scientists use their skills for social change We believe that social change should be an integral part of computer science culture and that this is often forgotten in the rush of campus culture We connect students to nonprofits that need their help lead code jams for nonprofit work and maintain a campus community for discussing the social impact of computer science Contact Andrew Suciu andrewsuciu at gmail dot com is a nonprofit that seeks to dismantle the untrue sterotype that computer science is not a career for women We work with the technology industry to create a culture that is more appealing to women and we work with young women across the globe to dismantle harmful perceptions that they can not succeed in the technology industry Our outreach includes an annual fellowship for high school students an ambassador program for college students and the creation of online videos and campaigns We are rebranding technology to be less about the stereotypes and more about the the building and the impact By tackling the source of these stereotypes we hope to create a field where women feel included respected and valued We are a 501 c 3 nonprofit run by Stanford undergraduate students RESOURCES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS Women in Science and Engineering WISE For graduate students and postdocs WISE groups are professionally facilitated weekly meetings on issues relevant to group members such as

talks and tutorials by senior and junior women in the field as well as social events and activities Workshop for Women in Machine Learning December with NIPS conference Deadline September This workshop gives female faculty research scientists and graduate students in the machine learning community an opportunity to meet exchange ideas and learn from each other Underrepresented minorities and undergraduates interested in machine learning research are encouraged to attend Future Science Leaders Workshop September University The Future Science Leaders program is led by Katherine Blumdell Oxford University for women researchers in physics math and fields The objective is to explore challenges that scientists face today techniques for scientists to succeed in research and to educate
