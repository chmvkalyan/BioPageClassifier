Recreational Operation The FAA has different regulations for recreational UAS operation and civil UAS operation Recreational operation is strictly limited to the operation of UAS for personal interests and enjoyment Use of a UAS for any other reason is considered civil operation Under FAA rules any use of a UAS for university business including faculty research and sponsored research or any purpose is considered civil operation also known as operation As detailed below under Student Academic Operation there are limited circumstances where student UAS operation for the student own academic pursuits may be considered recreational operation Recreational operators must abide by the following FAA guidelines Register the UAS with the FAA Fly at or below 400 feet Keep the UAS within visual line of sight Never flight near other aircraft especially near airports Never fly over groups of people Never fly over stadiums or sports events Never fly near emergency response efforts such as fires Never fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol Be aware of FAA airspace restrictions see FAA B4UFLY Smartphone App Source FAA Fly for Fun website Civil Operation Civil UAS operation includes any UAS operation that is not strictly for the operator own personal interest and enjoyment Examples of civil operation include but are not limited to UAS operation for faculty or staff research projects UAS operation by faculty staff or students for any sponsored research Student UAS operation for use in research or sponsored research UAS operation for aerial photography for use in any purpose UAS operation for any university business purpose The FAA recently issued new regulations effective August 28 2016 concerning the civil operation of UAS These new regulations simplify the

financial compensation for the UAS operation including reimbursement of costs honorariums scholarships etc The student does not operate the UAS in connection with the professional duties research publication objectives of a faculty or staff member The student does not operate the UAS in connection with any sponsored project FAA guidance also specifies that because faculty and staff are paid employees faculty or staff operation of UAS in connection with their professional duties is considered civil operation operation Therefore faculty and staff who operate UAS in connection with their employment must satisify the FAA regulations for civil UAS operation However the FAA does provide a limited exception whereby a faculty instructor may provide limited assistance to student UAS operation in connection with the teaching of a course that uses UAS For this exception to apply the UAS operation must be secondary to the design and construction of the aircraft such that the primary purpose of the course is not to provide instruction on UAS operation For example this exception would apply to an engineering course with a component on the of a UAS But the exception would not apply where the primary purpose of the course is to provide instruction on UAS flight operations FAA Registration For recreational operations all UAS with a maximum weight greater than 250 grams approximately 9 ounces must register with the FAA prior to outdoor operation and may register via the FAA s new online registration system Personally owned UAS operated solely for recreational purposes may be registered on the FAA website at https For civil operations all UAS regardless of weight must register with the FAA prior to any outdoor operation The Office of Risk Management and
