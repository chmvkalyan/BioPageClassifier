learning research focuses on improving the Fairness Accountability and Transparency FAccT of a model in addition to its performance Although FAccT will be difficult to achieve emerging technical approaches in this topic show promise in making better FAccT AI systems In this course we will study the rigorous computer science necessary foundations for FAccT deep learning and dive into the technical underpinnings of topics including fairness robustness interpretability accountability and privacy These topics reflect research in FAccT are socially important and they have strong industrial interest due to government and other policy regulation This course will focus on the algorithmic and statistical methods needed to approach FAccT AI from a deep learning perspective We will also discuss several application areas where we can apply these techniques P more Deep AI systems have demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities A growing field in deep learning research focuses
