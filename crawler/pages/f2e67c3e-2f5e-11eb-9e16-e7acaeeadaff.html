Krause and the work of Pauline Oliveros the piece functions as a futuristic reflection on the evolution of sound across species while using spacialized and manipulated field recordings to create new sonic terrain Project Overview Development Goal To create a ritualistic performance system using spacialized audio signals video and audio manipulation Background As part of continued research I aim to pursue an experience that combines spatialized field recordings voice and software For this piece I may continue to develop a water sensor into the performance using some sort of vessel s water conductive tape and a bare conductive microcontroller The audio collection process will include listening recording and engaging with a series of natural and sounds The piece will culminate in an performance Possible Controllers water controller prototype mask prototype mask sensors WK1 Brainstorming Testing Performance Site Listening Room Okay to burn use scents No Issues in the past Dry Ice

sensor input to video mixer patch Collect Field Recordings Fire Machines Energy Facility Electrical Drone Sounds WK2 Testing Collection Water Sensor Testing in Max 1 I managed to get data into Max from the Bare Conductive microcontroller After a few minutes the microcontroller seems to get overloaded and freezes If I reload the Arduino code onto the board data starts to work in Max temporarily This issue seems relatively consistent My laptop also seems to be having trouble processing video and receiving data at the same time The latency of sensor data into Max is painfully slow while video is running Sensor response is proficient with no video processing I will need a new laptop This is not a surprise Readings Keywords in Sound Chapter 15 Resonance by Veit Erlmann the concept of resonance having been derived from core epistemological virtues such as intuition observation and experiment names the natural mechanism governing the interaction of vibrating matter such as strings nerves and air As such resonance is the Other of the Cartesian ego as it discovers truth of musical harmony for instance and reassures itself of its own existence as a thinking entity On the other hand resonance names the very unity of body and mind that the cogitating ego must unthink before it uncovers truth Erlmann page 177 Keywords in Sound Chapter 17 Space by Andrew Eisenberg As a phenomenon that exists at once within and beyond perceiving subjects sound can not but reveal social space as an artifact of material practices complexly interwoven with semiotic processes and the

World Murray Schaffer Chapter 12 Symbolism water the original life element has the most splendid symbolism a stream a fountain a river a waterfall the sea each makes its unique sound but all share rich symbolism They speak of cleansing of purification of refreshment and renewal It is symbolic of eternity It is symbolic of change Schafer page 170 Without its tactile pressure on the face or body we can not even tell from what direction it blows The wind is therefore not to be trusted Schafer page 170 Modern man has sought to escape both the wind and the sea by encapsulating himself in artificial environments The sounds of machines took on happy symbolism approximately 200 years ago when it was realized that they could release man from his immemorial bondage to earth power and progress noise and power go hand in hand Schafer page To do Research options for new laptop 2015 Macbook Pro Stanford support Mask controller into Max Build simple looper Edit field recordings WK3 More Testing Collecting Simple Audio Looper Interface for Testing Max MIDI Controller I built a simple looper patch in Max in order to start manipulating and listening to field recordings from my recent sound hunts Lately I been interested in machine sounds that have similar qualities as sounds from nature similar to how cars sound similar to the ocean or specific electrical resonances sound like cicadas and crickets audio test 2 Readings the wind began to funnel down from the high southern pass gaining more forces with each passing moment The effect was a chord exactly but rather a combination of tones sighs and midrange groans that played off each other sometimes setting strange beats into resonance as they nearly matched one another in pitch strangely dissonant While never unpleasant the acoustic experience was disorienting Krause pg 37 The Great Animal Orchestra Finding the Origins of Music in the World Wild Places Bernie Kraus To do Research 2015 Macbook Pro SLAC

revitalized my interest in musique concr√®te Today I spent some time digging around Searchworks for online audio In my hunt so far I have found several resources that rely heavily on field recordings from nature to form audio compositions Here are a few Arctic Winds Maggie Payne 2010 Gateway Summer Sound Abstracted Animal and Other Sounds Ann McMillan 1979 Desert Winds Six Windblown Sound Pieces and Other Works Scott Smallwood 2007 Highlights of Vortex 1959 Smithsonian Folkways Recordings 2003 SLAC Site Visit The tour of SLAC was a bit of a disappointment but only because I did fully comprehend the context of the tour I did realize our MFA tour was part of a larger public tour Unfortunately it was nearly impossible to record an audio sample without and human ruckus We only visited two small areas of the facilities which did really give an overall impression of the scale of the accelerometer There were however some oscillations coming from machinery that I would like to revisit under a more tour of SLAC Outside of my sound hunt it was astounding to hear about the some of the research taking place Floor Plan Spacial Thoughts Light Sound Water Experiments 3 4 5 To do Visit Listening Room Contact Nando for Listening Room Orientation Contact Nette for LR keycard access Book out LR rehearsal schedule Purchase 2015 Macbook Pro WK5 I spent this week trying to iron out logistics I met with Nando for a Listening Room orientation and am now considering the best way to execute signal routing in the space Nando recommended I check out the Listening Room User Manual on the CCRMA website For now I thinking I address each speaker individually rather than working with ambisonics It sounds like I need to use Jack to interface with my computer Speaking of computer I bought a laptop It should arrive next week I was also able to arrange keycard access to the room and am still trying to pin down scheduling for rehearsal and official performance showtimes Possible Performance Date s Friday June 1 4pm doors performance OR 7pm doors performance Saturday June 2 4pm doors performance AND 7pm doors performance WK6 Listening Room Mixing Routing Research 6 Listening Room User Guide Openmixer Manual Input Sources Using Jack After visiting the Listening Room and looking at the infrastructure in place I decided not to do any projection that requires hanging additional material in the space It will likely be a lot of work and ultimately be invasive to the experience For now I like to focus on the sound and possibly incorporate some simple caustic lighting elements I considering options for reflecting light onto the grid that separates the floor from the lower level of the heptagon This will require some sort of that could easily be placed on the grid I will need to be sure there is airflow so as not to cause any issues with the ventilation system which feeds into the lower level To do Install Max 22 Channel Routing in Max Source RSVP Platform for Performance Contact Eoin for Listening Room Consultation Dry Ice Testing WK7 Signal Routing Listening Room Consultation My new computer finally arrived and I was able to schedule some time with Eoin to test routing options in the Listening Room I opted to use a 16ch analog interface and Jacknet which will magically give me access to all 22 channels I need to do more specific routing in Max but was able to get a signal out of my laptop and play audio over all 22 channels with minimal and mysterious machine behavior Eoin is awesome I am consistently amazed at the generosity of the CCRMA community and am so grateful to have the opportunity to interact and learn from everyone Listening Room Booking Conflicts I spoke to Matt Wright about any potential overlap with SLOrk rehearsal and general usage of the Listening Room After our conversation it seems best to bump my performance dates back one week so as to avoid any scheduling conflicts Matt has also been kind enough to book out the space for me overnight so I will only need to and teardown once Wooo Yay for CCRMA peeps RVSP Platform Dates I decided to use Eventbrite for RSVP I got a draft going and am seconds away from pulling the trigger Just need to finish up my statement about the piece and am currently wrestling with language and an official title So close Friday June 8th 7pm doors performance Saturday June 9th 4pm doors performance Dry Ice Tests Working with dry ice has been waaay more fun than I could have anticipated With that said I learning that the fun comes with a heftier fee than I originally thought and it evaporates fairly quickly A block of dry ice lasts for approximately 2 or 3 days at about 20 each I also discovered that the dry ice goes bananas until it eaten up all of the oxygen in whatever water it dropped into at which point the dry ice fizzles sadly with much less gusto This happens fairly quickly I think it will be fine for the performance but it possible I will need larger containers to house the water and dry I been most excited about projecting onto the dry ice and am thinking about ways to use the dry ice as the projection for the performance To do Signal Routing Hierarchy in Max Publish Distribute RVSP Invite Test Dry Ice in Listening Room Test Scent Machine in Listening Room Okay to Point Listening Room Projector Straight Down Onto Grid Order More Fans Dry Ice Containers Scent Containers Edit new sounds WK8 Testing Rehearsal Findings I discovered that my USB MIDI controller will not work at the same time as the USB MOTU interface I am using to route sound in the Listening Room This is a major problem I contacted Eoin for advice and am hoping that using an ethernet connection will help resolve this issue I also thinking about adding a second computer into the mix mainly because of software limitations on my new computer I not sure if this is going to cause a whole heap of other headaches but mentioned my interest to Eoin If it seems to I stick with one laptop Testing Rehearsal Audio Recording 1 Recording 2 Dry Ice Testing My first rounds of dry ice tests in the Listening Room proved to be somewhat unsuccessful The ventilation system below the grid sucks all of the dry ice vapors straight down and disburses them making it difficult to see anything interesting happening I tried placing a container of dry ice into a secondary container with edges slightly higher than the vessel holding the dry ice This produced some really interesting behaviors so I guessing I can do something similar at a larger scale hopefully filling the majority of the recess in the Listening Room floor I been spending a good lump of time searching for containers to hold the dry ice Whatever I use needs to be fairly large to help with the longevity of the vapors but also not so large that it will be difficult to schlep it out of the room once the performance is over There also a slight chance that whatever I use to house the dry ice will be visible in some capacity so I also trying to find something that is fairly simple in design and also cheapish since I will be covering a lot of area I been looking at all kinds of containers and have really found the right thing yet I found something that will work but I not very excited about it For the secondary I am thinking about building out a frame that will fit inside of the heptagon I would then line the frame with a black tarp or some sort of black fabric leaving a few inches between the frame and the interior edge of the heptagon for air flow Speaking of the sound of the dry ice bubbling in the water is becoming a wonderful bonus in the soundscape of my performance Listening to the dry ice is sort of like sitting by a babbling creek so I could have asked for a more exciting and unexpected surprise Projector Testing Initially I was thinking about using the projector that is already mounted in the Listening Room After further examination I realized that the throw will probably not work well for my purposes I did some tests with one of the PICO projectors and it seems like it might work okay It probably wo be the brightest most vivid projection but I think that will be okay in this case The dry ice is awesome with even just a little bit of light on it I bought a few small clamp mounts for any of the tiny projectors that enter into the I should be able to mount the projectors fairly easily using the rigging system in the ceiling Project Statement Earth frequencies are the foundation of in communication and survival for all living creatures Insects birds and humans have all evolved to make sound in accordance with the landscapes in which they dwell yet humans increasingly suffocate the soundscape turning a blind ear to the sonic residue of industry and electromagnetic poisons Incursion is a performance that examines how natural order might adapt soncially to human impressions on the evolution of voice across species Through the use of spatialized and processed field recordings Incursion gestures toward a futuristic bending of familiar sonic terrain twisted by the influence of machinery Incursion is a poetic attempt to prophesize what the future may hold in relation to the expressive abilities and survival of sounding creatures on Earth Do birds sing differently now that they are encumbered with the ruckus of industrialized human existence RSVP Event Link To do Find door person USB MIDI controller does not currently work while running USB MOTU 16ch interface Can I use two computers x1 for mask x1 for field recordings Define performance zone altar WK9 Listening Room Tech There was some mystery unplugging of a bunch of stuff in the Listening Room which was causing some behavior With the help and head scratching of Eoin and Nando the mystery has been solved and things seem to be relatively stable Phew My MIDI controller also seems to be behaving for the most part I been using a power USB hub which seems to be doing the trick although I have a feeling the USB port on my controller is starting to get a little loose Hopefully it hangs in there for the performances Dry Ice I still struggling with the dry ice component of the piece I do think I be able to work at the scale I like mainly due to the cost of materials I think I found a solution on a smaller scale but I not super excited about it Because of the scale change it likely I need to abandon the projection component Hard to say for sure at this point but unless some miracle moment happens much of the visual components of the piece will be far diminished from what I would like to do in an ideal world where I rolling in cash and have an absorbent amount of time SLOrk SLOrk moves out of the Listening Room on Wednesday evening This means I will be able to leave things and start to deal with cables and placement In the interim I been doing some small lighting test and think I have a fairly simple plan for lighting including the hallway leading up to the Listening Room Printed Program I nearly finished working on a program for the performances I think I will alter my statement to better describe all of the adjustments I had to make and use language to indicate that it still a work in progress I assume it fine to print the program at CCRMA Sound At this point I so buried in the piece that I can no longer tell heads from tails I introduced a piezo as part of the altar and have been testing various vocal utterances Compositionally I not totally sure where the piece is at or how far away I fallen from my original intent Currently the piece is leaning toward something more musical than I originally imagined I removed the glockenspiel recording and have been working with more of a droning sound that I recorded using a synth There a cohesiveness to the sound but what I been developing is seemingly less like a soundscape even though there is an abundance of field recordings incorporated into the work I suppose I feeling a little confused and could use some time away from the piece for reflection but as is the whole shebang is feeling arbitrary and far removed but maybe I too immersed in the process to it for what it is To do Complete Program Print Do I need a code for the printer Still trying to find a door person Lighting Rehearsal Testing WK10 Culminating Configuration Voice Ultimately I opted not to use the sensors embedded in the mask and only incorporated the microphone into the performance system combined with some generous filtering in Ablteon Live The signal from the microphone was passed through a MOTU interface with access to 22 discreet channels in the Listening Room My voice occupied channels and a handful of channels in the ceiling and floor Piezo Instrument Because of the whole debacle with my laptop I strayed away from experimenting with the Bare Conductive Touch Board and water in this instance Instead I incorporated the glass bowl from my conductivity tests to make an instrument that is comprised of a piezo the glass bowl metal feathers and software I fed the signal into Ableton for the instrument input within the same patch as my mic I was able to output both signals as two separate channels to the MOTU interface allowing me to route the instrument signal discreetly over the 22ch system I chose to route the instrument to channels and the center ceiling speaker Field Recording Manipulation For all of the field recordings I continued to use Max and a MIDI controller to manipulate and navigate recorded audio signals Rather than processing the sound through filters I built a system where I am simply manipulating the speed and direction of each recorded sample Most sounds are configured to play at a rate well below half speed and are occasionally played backward In addition to the field recordings I also recorded improvisational synthesizer sessions One of the first synth recordings I made in my process used the glockenspiel voice After some feedback I questioned if the glockenspiel was pulling the piece in a more musical direction and whether or not I would be okay with that in relation to my interest in the evolution of sound and soundscapes I decided I was okay with the piece becoming more musical but felt that the synth could better match the electrical and sounds already incorporated into the piece I believe I ultimately used some sort of electric piano voice on the synth to create a droney circular sound Once the synth sound was in Max I made the happy discovery that the drone sound was a friendly match with some mosquito buzzing already incorporated into the composition and committed to using the drone sound in the composition Video treep loop video For the video I used a looped recording of layered trees composed in Max along with a Nano projector a Raspberry Pi media player and a fancy clamp that allowed me to mount the projector off of a in the ceiling The Nano projector is battery powered with a long enough life that I did need to bother with any cabling or power routing to the projector PEDCO UltraClamp Dry Ice The dry ice component ultimately caused me a lot of duress and in the end felt like an arbitrary gesture I was unable to work at the scale I would have liked without having to spend a ton of extra money to combat the ventilation system under the heptagon grid I suppose I felt obligated to incorporate it somehow after spending so much time researching and sourcing the material but am cognizant of its kitschy nature and feel unresolved around its use in this iteration of my performance research With that said I love the gurgling sound of the dry ice in water and would be keen to amplify and work with the sound in some form if I continue to work with dry ice in the future
