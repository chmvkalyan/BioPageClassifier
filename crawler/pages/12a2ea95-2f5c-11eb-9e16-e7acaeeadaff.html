important to me While my first concern like everyone else is mitigating the direct risk of the pandemic I have a salient concern about the risks that could be introduced if the global manufacturing supply chain for medical devices is disrupted I a Type I diabetic who relies on a continuous glucose monitor CGM device to monitor my blood sugar and an insulin pump for insulin injections In this blog post I explore strategies that vendors can use to prepare and account for disruptions to hardware and software supply chains disruptions that could affect devices that end users rely on Risk Management The National Institute for Standards and Technology NIST defines the Information and Communications Technology ICT supply chain as a linked set of resources and processes between acquirers integrators and suppliers that begins with the design of ICT products and services and extends through development sourcing manufacturing handling and delivery of ICT products and services to the acquirer It is important to differentiate between software risk and software security risk A 2014 SEI technical note defined risk as the probability of suffering harm or loss It went on to define security risk as a measure of 1 the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability to produce an adverse consequence or loss and 2 the magnitude of the loss The case of will directly impact software risk which may also create ancillary software security risk Risk management is needed to identify analyze and respond to the risks associated with the supply chain The CERT Resilience Management Model lists the following main goals for risk management prepare establish risk parameters and focus identify risks analyze risks address risks and use risk information to manage resilience The also includes a chapter on external dependencies management that specifically focuses on ensuring resilience when services or assets depend on actions of external entities which is directly applicable to supply chains Risk in Medical Devices The two types of devices that I use to manage my diabetes operate independently The output of a CGM Figure 1 a reading helps me calculate how much insulin to take so my blood sugar is controlled to prevent or reduce complications A person with diabetes could use a CGM an insulin pump Figure 2 or both together If a key hardware component of these devices were to become unavailable or compromised because of realized risks to the supply chain any users who depend on the device could have to switch to a new vendor or product or could be adversely affected by a newly emerging security vulnerability Figure 1 Continuous Glucose Monitor CGM Figure 2 Insulin Pump An insulin pump Figure 2 commonly has a plastic shell a circuit board with microcontroller batteries and a cannula or tube that delivers the insulin beneath the skin Those and other parts must be sourced and assembled The electronics mean that there is also a software supply chain The software controls insulin delivery including scheduling insulin ratios correction ratios alarms and more Modern pumps and CGM also communicate over radio frequencies introducing software to manage communications in addition to the software managing the medication pump Some devices also may send data back to the vendor analytics platform to provide patients and doctors with deeper insights into trends and potential treatment improvements At the intersection of hardware and software switching to an equivalent hardware component can cause software performance issues For CGMs and pumps new versions of devices often require new software which might cover the device firmware user interfaces on hardware interfaces with mobile apps software to transport data to the cloud and interfaces for trusted third parties such as family members or doctors requirements mean that any disruption in one link in the chain can lead to additional complications Sourcing and assembly are the parts of this supply chain that would most likely be disrupted as a result of the spread of the coronavirus Software development whether or outsourced may also experience varying degrees of impact from illness social distancing and quarantines These disruptions could affect new software releases upgrades and security patches Security could also be affected if disruptions result in the use of software with unknown vulnerabilities Risks that Pandemics and Other External Events Could Introduce Even in the best of times manufacturers are confronted with the risk of supply interruptions and delays and the potential to receive corrupt components The introduction of new products presents a special challenge In the past I have seen vendor of a novel device in the CGM market struggle to ship on time To the vendor a new product means retooling factories finding new suppliers training personnel in manufacturing and customer support developing and distributing new clearing regulatory hurdles and more All these factors must be addressed while simultaneously trying to accurately forecast demand from current customers switching products or from new customers adopting the new product External events such as the current pandemic can hamper production exacerbating existing challenges and introducing new ones Factors that could affect performance include trade wars shortages recalls and safety scares and climate change among others For example some analysts believe that Apple 5G iPhone will be delayed as a result of production disruptions in China While a large company such as Apple could have the option of switching production to alternate factories in other countries smaller companies have fewer options On a more immediate level we seen common products such as disinfectant wet wipes toilet paper and food staples out of stock in stores showing that risk leads to failures when demand spikes or production is slowed The pandemic has introduced slowdowns complexity and heightened risk into global commerce One technology example of risk emerging in the current pandemic environment is the widespread movement of software resources to the cloud Increased use of cloud services is driven by the need for organizations to increase capacity quickly to accommodate changed work environments such as an increase in the number of employees who are working from home and who are conducting online meetings Demand for cloud computing services has soared during the pandemic In previous SEI blog posts we have identified best practices for cloud security and 12 risks threats and vulnerabilities in moving to the cloud Cloud service providers and their services are part of the software supply chain and organizations moving to the cloud must understand and account for the risks that such increased reliance represents and how cloud adoption alters the organization risk profile reducing some risks while increasing others Altering architecture and processes to leverage cloud computing advantages can also alter software security risks for example by transferring some of the risk to the cloud service provider The Vendor Point of View Planning for and Responding to Disruptions How do vendors manage the risk of a disruption The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA issued the following recommendations for chains as part of its publication related to risk management Assess your organization supply chain for potential impacts from disruption of transport logistics and international manufacturing slowdowns resulting from Discuss with those suppliers any challenges they may be facing or may expect to face due to the ongoing situation Identify potential alternate sources of supply substitute products conservation measures to mitigate disruptions Communicate with key customers to keep them informed of any issues you have identified and the steps you are taking to mitigate them To understand risks in software vendors must first understand all the software included in their devices Software supply chains are increasingly complex and an initial step in managing risk is to identify the crucial pieces of software on which organizations rely An effort by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA the Software Bill of Materials SBOM underscores the importance of transparency in addressing risk The NTIA SBOM is a nested inventory list of ingredients that make up software components It provides detailed guidance on the benefits of having an SBOM from the perspective of those who make software those who choose or buy software and those who operate it It is also important for vendors to understand all software dependencies The ownership and responsibility for software may be scattered across several organizations each of which may affect the security and integrity of the final product A device vendor will have software dependencies related to their hardware and its operation but also their whole infrastructure will depend on vendor software for operating systems network devices engineering programs logistics manufacturing plant management and more Four Approaches to Secure the Supply Chain Alternatives for vendors during disruption will probably be constricted due to regulatory requirements lower production shifts in demand The best time for a vendor to start examining alternatives is when planning the supply chain but the next best time is immediately While it is always harder to fix things after they are implemented it is never too late to conduct a full risk assessment even if the immediate circumstances require a vendor to take shortcuts in the near term The provides guidance on managing operational risks to maintain resilience and can be used to initiate or mature programs The National Institute for Standards and Technology NIST Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations subdivides strategies for handling risks as accept transfer avoid and mitigate For suppliers transferring or mitigating risks are the two achievable and reasonable strategies to accept or avoid would put the entire business at risk It seems unlikely that all risk could be transferred but some combination of insurance and agreements among vendors across the supply chain could transfer at least part of the organizational risk Approaches for mitigating risk include Source resources and assembly well ahead of time to provide a buffer against a disruption Monitor the situation and implement actions when appropriate A action might be to start sourcing alternatives when inventory falls below a certain threshold In this case a pandemic could still cause disruption but risk is reduced by providing a time cushion and developing contingencies Offer incentives to vendors if they maintain continuity of operations Implement a recovery strategy to quickly restore the original supply chain and minimize the impact Whether or not a medical supplier has alternatives being transparent with users about risks will help those users plan and more effectively manage their health Customers generally react positively to transparency if risk leads to disruptions that affect them For example in the case of customers with diabetes helping them prepare by suggesting that they get a backup supply of test strips and finger lancets is a one way to minimize risk Helping customers navigate obtaining an extra few months supply of pumps or CGM supplies before disruption is another option Many vendors of diabetic supplies and other medical equipment have posted messages to their websites so that customers know whether their supply chains are experiencing disruption that could slow product deliveries These same principles of transparency and clear communication apply to all situations in which end users rely on vendors to supply products on which their health and depend risk is being amply demonstrated by the current pandemic but proper planning and execution can help reduce organizational risks related to disruptions In contrast a lack of visibility poor planning and panic can all contribute to confusion when dealing with disruptions A systematic approach can reduce this confusion and risk Although this post is by no means I hope it provides some thoughtful information to help and that organizations and individuals are able to endure the disruptions and then use their experience to become more resilient Additional Resources Read the SEI blog post 4 Elements in Securing the Telecommunications Supply
