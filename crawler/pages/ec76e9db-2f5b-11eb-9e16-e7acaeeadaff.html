Division Finance Division Annual Financial Report 2019 Highlights from the CIO Investment Highlights from Charles Kennedy Chief Investment Officer Overview Built on a foundation of generous gifts and augmented by careful financial stewardship Carnegie Mellon University s endowment stood at a market value of billion as of June 30 2019 The endowment is an important strategic asset of the university Carnegie Mellon seeks to advance knowledge and understanding in science technology fine arts and the humanities through its research and education mission By providing a permanent and consistent source of funding for scholarships professors salaries laboratory equipment the endowment enables Carnegie Mellon s faculty and student researchers to carry out the university s mission by attacking difficult problems Critically endowment support for tuition assistance helps attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse student body With its perpetual life the endowment is uniquely situated to provide funding today and in the future to advance the university s mission and to help Carnegie Mellon students and faculty achieve their goals and aspirations Strategy and Allocation The endowment s portfolio of investments is managed with a view and evaluated by its effectiveness in achieving over time two fundamental objectives 1 generating steady and substantial financial support for students faculty and programs and 2 balancing current demands for support with the goal at a minimum of maintaining the endowment s real purchasing power for future generations preserving intergenerational equity To maximize expected returns within acceptable levels of risk and liquidity Carnegie Mellon designed its policy asset allocation using a combination of academic theory quantitative analysis and informed market judgment To achieve the objectives stated above Carnegie Mellon targets broad portfolio exposure of 85 percent equities for growth and appreciation and 15 percent fixed income to provide stability and liquidity Fiscal year 2019 marks the 15th anniversary of the university s decision to shift equities focus from traditional publicly traded investments to private investments primarily utilizing private equity funds globally We believe that over the long term private equity investment returns will exceed the returns available from investing in public securities enabling the endowment to make larger contributions to the university mission Figure 1 details asset allocation targets and actual allocations as of June 30 2019 Figure1 Asset Allocation Policy Targets and Actual Allocations As depicted in Figure 1 a point compared to target to and international public equities was offset by a similar to directional hedge funds private investments in real assets and growth fixed income This difference between policy targets and actual amounts is primarily due to a large cash influx to the endowment in fiscal year 2017 that was invested in public equities for capital appreciation pending reallocation of an appropriate share to new private investment opportunities to be identified and funded in coming years At this 15th anniversary of the pursuit of the university s strategy Carnegie Mellon s private portfolio is maturing However due to the influx of new capital achieving the private investments target which was generally achieved in fiscal year 2016 will require several years of commitments capital calls and the maturing of underlying investments Fortunately Carnegie Mellon s endowment is of a size that permits new reasonably sized commitments to investment managers that will be meaningful to the endowment s asset allocation and investment return Investment Performance The university s net investment return for fiscal year 2019 was percent More significantly given the goals of the investment strategy and the noise versus signal often associated with equity results Carnegie Mellon s and returns were percent percent and percent respectively These returns compare favorably with relevant benchmarks Endowment Attribution The endowment s market value increased to million as of June 30 2019 from million as of June 30 2018 This net increase of approximately million reflects the collective impact of million from gifts and other sources plus million from investment gains less million of distributions to support the university s operations As depicted in Figure 2 for the period ended June 30 2019 the endowment s market value increased approximately million from a beginning market value of million reflecting the collective impact of million from gifts and other sources plus million from investment gains less million of distributions to support the university s operations Figure 2 Endowment Bridge dollars in millions As previously noted cash distributions from the endowment the draw provide a key source of support for various university activities and programs ranging from general operations to specific needs such as scholarships and professorships Fiscal year 2019 marks the sixth consecutive year in which endowment support as a percentage of the operating budget increased starting with percent of the university s operations in fiscal year 2013 and rising to percent in fiscal year 2019 This relatively higher level of support was achieved while the university s operating expenditures grew However the endowment contribution to university operations is only about that of other universities with endowments greater than 1 billion and even smaller when compared to a more select group of peer academic institutions This leaves Carnegie Mellon more dependent on tuition and sponsored research than its peers reducing financial flexibility to pursue its research and education mission This variance can be attributed to the relatively young life of Carnegie Mellon which was created in 1967 through the merger of Carnegie Institute of Technology and Mellon Institute During most of the university s existence financial resources donated by supporters have been focused more on capital infrastructure and current program needs than on endowment savings As a result Carnegie Mellon s endowment is significantly smaller both in absolute terms and on a basis relative to peer academic institutions This shortfall is being addressed through a greater focus on building the endowment over the long term The endowment s size and influence will grow only modestly through investment returns The level of future gifts to the university will significantly influence the endowment s level of future impact The historical activities of the endowment including the draw and its support expressed as a percentage of annual operations are summarized in Figure 3 Figure 3 Endowment Values and Attribution During the last decade the draw from the endowment has contributed on average approximately percent of the university s annual operating budget For fiscal year 2019 the draw from the endowment provided percent of the university s operating budget Viewed as a percentage of the annual budget the relative support from the draw is affected not only by the growth in the endowment and the draw formula see Note 7 on 23 of the consolidated financial statements but also by the growth in the university s annual operating budget which increased by an average of percent annually for the past decade The Dietrich Foundation The Dietrich Foundation established by Pittsburgh industrialist and longtime university trustee William Dietrich II was created to manage in perpetuity his gift of approximately 500 million in assets intended to benefit the university and other higher education and charitable institutions The Dietrich Foundation s assets are not reflected in the university s financial statements see additional information regarding the foundation in Note 17 on 38 of the consolidated financial statements The university s share of the annual distributions from The Dietrich Foundation is percent If this percentage is applied to the estimated value of The Dietrich Foundation s assets of million as of June 30 2019 and the result added to Carnegie Mellon s endowment of million the combination would total million Annual distributions from The Dietrich Foundation over time equal 3 percent of the value of the foundation s net assets as measured on January 1 of each year The Dietrich Foundation s gift added to Carnegie Mellon s endowment for fiscal year 2019 was million and cumulative gifts since the initial gift in fiscal year 2013 total million Summary Carnegie Mellon s endowment provides a permanent source of financial and operational stability which helps university leadership to perpetuate academic and research excellence in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive world Enduring generosity of alumni and friends and an investment program focused on compounding net returns for the long term should continue to increase the value of Carnegie Mellon s endowment over time providing ongoing support for the university s operating needs while preserving purchasing power to support future generations of students faculty and programs
