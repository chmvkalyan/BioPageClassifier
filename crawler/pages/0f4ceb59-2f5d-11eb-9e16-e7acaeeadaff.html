Matrix Theory Linear algebra for applications in science and engineering orthogonality projections spectral theory for symmetric matrices the singular value decomposition the QR decomposition the condition number of a matrix algorithms for solving linear systems Math 113 offers a more theoretical treatment of linear algebra Prerequisites Math 51 and programming experience on par with CS106nnMath 104 and cover complementary topics in applied linear algebra The focus of Math 104 is on algorithms and concepts the focus of EE103 is on a few linear algebra concepts and many applications Terms Aut Win Units 3 UG Reqs GER Instructors Feldheim O PI Ying PI Dore TA more instructors for MATH 104 Instructors Feldheim O PI Ying PI Dore TA He X TA McConnell TA Safaee TA Velcheva
