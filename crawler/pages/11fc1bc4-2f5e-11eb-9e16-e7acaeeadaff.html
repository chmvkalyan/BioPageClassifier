Advanced Machine Learning This advanced graduate course explores in depth several important classes of algorithms in modern machine learning We will focus on understanding the mathematical properties of these algorithms in order to gain deeper insights on when and why they perform well We will also study applications of each algorithm on interesting settings Topics include spectral clustering tensor decomposition Hamiltonian Monte Carlo adversarial training and variational approximation Students will learn mathematical techniques for analyzing these algorithms and experience in using them We will supplement the lectures with latest papers and there will be a significant research project component to the class Prerequisites Probability CS 109 linear algebra Math 113 machine learning CS 229 and some coding experience Last offered Spring 2017 CS 330 Deep and Meta Learning While deep learning has achieved remarkable success in supervised and reinforcement learning problems such as image classification speech recognition and game playing these models are to a large degree specialized for the single task they are trained for This course will cover the setting where there are multiple tasks to be solved and study how the structure arising from multiple tasks can benleveraged to learn more efficiently or effectively This includes reinforcement learning techniques that leverage the structure of the provided goal space to learn many tasks significantly faster methods that aim to learn efficient learning algorithms that can learn new tasks quickly curriculum and lifelong learning where the problem requires learning a sequence of tasks leveraging their shared structure to enable knowledge transfer This is a course By the end of the course students should be able to understand andnimplement the learning algorithms and be ready to conduct research on these topics Prerequisites CS 229 or equivalent Familiarity with deep learning reinforcement learning and
