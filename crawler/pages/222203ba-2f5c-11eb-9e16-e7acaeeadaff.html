Coursecast The homeworks are described on a different page Course Abstract Human computer interaction HCI is an interdisciplinary field in which computer scientists engineers psychologists social scientists and design professionals play important roles The goal of this field is to solve real problems in the design and use of technology making systems easier to use and more effective for people and organizations Ease of use and effectiveness are critical to the success of any systems that interact with people including software systems home office and factory appliances and web applications This course provides an overview and introduction to the field of interaction with a focus on how it applies to managers technology executives and others who will work with HCI professionals Particular emphasis will be placed on what HCI methods and specialists can bring to design and development teams The course will introduce students to tools and techniques for creating or improving user interfaces such as Contextual Inquiry Heuristic Analysis and User Testing Students at the end of the course will have learned some useful techniques and an understanding of systematic procedures for creating usable and useful designs and systems Some Evaluation Comments from Last Year Fall 2007 See complete evaluations on The class was very interesting I got to know more about how to design systems taking the user into consideration and how to design user interfaces that would give the user a better experience while using the system Very good introduction to HCI Course materials are good

However some experience with programming is expected This might be defined as one programming course Two homeworks will involve implementing small programs quickly and evaluating them with real users All programming will probably be in Visual Basic and the students are expected to be able to write these programs without too much trouble and without much help from the professor or TAs No background in HCI is expected Corequisites None Grading Grades will be based on 6 assignments and a final exam All assignments will be individual not group See the homeworks overview page Assignment Percent of
