replicate extend and comment on the weekly paper The first objective of the seminar is to develop an understanding of different elements of a field experiment To this end we will untangle project parts related to implementation data collection analysis and writing A typical weekly meeting will include the following discussion on framing and contribution to literature replication of the study material and potential extensions of the analysis We will also go through survey instruments and any other material made available by authors A second objective is to introduce students to writing plans for their own research Each student will be expected to prepare a detailed plan for a proposed experiment or and will have the opportunity to workshop this plan with the class towards the end of
