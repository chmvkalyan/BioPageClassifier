transition to a sustainable global energy system We will formulate and program simple models for future energy system pathways We will explore the drivers of global energy demand and carbon emissions as well as the technologies that can help us meet this demand sustainably We will consider constraints on the deployment of technology and difficulties of a transition at large scales and over long time periods Assignments will focus on building models of key aspects of the energy transition including global regional and sectoral energy demand and emissions as well as economics of change Prerequisites students should be comfortable with calculus and linear algebra Math 20 Math 51 and be familiar with computer programming CS106A CS106B We will use the Python programming language to build our models Terms Spr Units 3 UG Reqs Instructors Benson PI de Chalendar J PI Hennessy TA Spring ENERGY 104 3 units UG Reqs Class 3000 Section 01 Grading Letter or Credit Exception LEC Remote
