SQUARE project CERT researchers have developed an process for security requirements engineering to help organizations build security into the early stages of the production life cycle The SQUARE methodology consists of nine steps that generate a final deliverable of categorized and prioritized security requirements This project started in 2003 and continues research in the security requirements area developing the SQUARE method and its extensions associated tools and presenting and publishing the method at workshops and tutorials at conferences and in journals and books Requirements engineering defects including those in security requirements cost 10 to 200 times more to correct during implementation than if they are detected during requirements development A study found returns on investment of 12 to 21 percent when security analysis and secure engineering practices are introduced early in the development cycle Further it is very difficult and expensive to significantly improve the security of an application after it is fielded in its operational environment In this workshop we will present an overview of security requirements engineering and the SQUARE methodology Then we will go through the SQUARE steps in detail For each step students will participate in a team case study We will then discuss some of the research and transition activities These include 1 an abbreviated version of SQUARE 2 SQUARE integrated into various lifecycle models 3 SQUARE for Privacy 4 SQUARE for Acquisition We will also discuss the current SQUARE tool development effort in support of the original SQUARE and and other topics of interest Audience The target audience includes software managers and technical leads software engineers and requirements engineers who are concerned with security requirements in developed or acquired software Security specialists who are involved in security requirements specification would benefit from this course Objectives Attendees will understand the challenges of security requirements engineering Attendees will learn the importance of developing security requirements in the same time frame as functional requirements rather than as an patch Attendees will learn why the methods used to identify functional requirements may not work directly for security requirements Attendees will be exposed to methods for security risk analysis security requirements elicitation and security requirements prioritization Attendees will learn how to apply the SQUARE method for security requirements engineering Topics Overview of security requirements engineering Overview of SQUARE Overview of and study of SQUARE steps including a case study Discussion of current research and available tools Materials Participants will receive Course notebook containing the course materials Case study materials SQUARE Technical Report Copy of Addison Wesley book Software Security Engineering A Guide for Project Managers CD containing the SQUARE tool suite Prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites although knowledge of software engineering processes in general and requirements engineering in particular would be helpful Alternatively knowledge of software security and the associated requirements issues would be helpful Inquire About This Course Schedule This course meets at the following times This course may be
