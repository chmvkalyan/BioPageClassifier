Cyber Risk Emerging Technologies Resilience Management Model RMM Risk As part of an ongoing effort to keep you informed about our latest work I would like to let you know about some recently published SEI technical reports and notes These reports highlight the latest work of SEI technologists in malware analysis acquisition strategies network situational awareness resilience management with three reports from this research area incident management and future architectures This post includes a listing of each report author s and links where the published reports can be accessed on the SEI website Using Malware Analysis to Tailor SQUARE for Mobile PlatformsBy Gregory Paul Alice and Nancy Mead As the number of software applications has grown so has the amount of malware targeting them More than pieces of malware now target the Android platform As mobile malware becomes more sophisticated and begins to approach threat levels seen on PC platforms software development security practices for mobile applications will need to adopt the security practices for PC applications to reduce consumers exposure to financial and privacy breaches on mobile platforms This technical note explores the development of security requirements for the Mail application an open source email client for the Android operating system The project case study 1 used the Security Quality Requirements Engineering SQUARE methodology to develop Mail security requirements and 2 used malware analysis to identify new security requirements in a proposed extension to the SQUARE process This second task analyzed the impacts of DroidCleaner a piece of Android malware on the security goals of the Mail application Based on the findings new requirements are created to ensure that similar malware can not compromise the privacy and confidentiality of email a PDF of the report A Method for Aligning Acquisition Strategies and Software ArchitecturesBy Lisa Brownsword Cecilia Albert David Carney Patrick Place In the acquisition of a system the relationship between the software architecture and the acquisition strategy is typically not carefully examined To remedy this lack a research team at the SEI has focused a multiyear effort to discover an initial set of failure patterns that result when these entities become misaligned and identify a set of desired relationships among the business and mission goals system and software architectures and the acquisition strategy This report describes the result of the third year of the SEI research where the team defined a method that indicates such areas of misalignment between a program architecture and acquisition strategy The alignment method is used as early in a program lifetime as practical ideally before the architecture or acquisition strategy has attained full definition The authors illustrate the method by means of a case study during which many of the key elements of the method were a PDF of the report Smart Collection and Storage Method for Network Traffic DataBy Angela Horneman Nathan Dell Captured network data enables an organization to perform routine tasks such as network situational awareness and incident response to security alerts The process of capturing storing and evaluating network traffic as part of monitoring is an increasingly complex and critical problem With networks and network traffic volumes traffic capture solutions can require petabytes of storage for a single day The capacity needed to store captures for a time frame that permits the needed analysis is unattainable for many organizations A tiered network storage solution which stores only the most critical or effective types of traffic in captures and the rest as summary data can help organizations mitigate the storage issues while providing the detailed information they need This report discusses considerations and decisions to be made when designing a tiered network data storage solution It includes a method based on a model that can help organizations decide what types of network traffic to store at each storage tier The report also uses network measurements to show how storage requirements change based on what traffic is stored in which storage a PDF of the report CERT Resilience Management Model Process Areas Mail Induction Version By Julia Allen Greg Crabb Postal Inspection Service Pamela Curtis Nader Mehravari David White Developing and implementing measurable methodologies for improving the security and resilience of a national postal sector directly contribute to protecting public and postal personnel assets and revenues Such methodologies also contribute to the security and resilience of the mode of transport used to carry mail and the protection of the global mail supply chain Since 2011 the Postal Inspection Service USPIS has collaborated with the SEI CERT Division to improve the resilience of selected Postal Service USPS products and services The CERT Resilience Management Model and its companion diagnostic methods served as the foundational tool for this collaboration This report includes one result of the collaboration It is an extension of to include a new process area for the induction acceptance of mail into the domestic mail stream The purpose is to ensure that mail is collected and accepted in accordance with USPS standards and requirements for the resilience of mail during the induction a PDF of the report CERT Resilience Management Model Process Areas Mail Revenue Assurance Version By Julia Allen Greg Crabb Postal Inspection Service Pamela Curtis Nader Mehravari David White Developing and implementing measurable methodologies for improving the security and resilience of a national postal sector directly contribute to protecting public

ensure that all international mail is transported in accordance with the standards established by the Universal Postal Union UPU which is the governing body that regulates the transportation of international a PDF of the report A Systematic Approach for Assessing Workforce ReadinessBy Christopher Alberts David McIntire Workforce effectiveness relies on two critical characteristics competence and readiness Competence is the sufficient mastery of the knowledge skills and abilities needed to perform a given task It reflects how well an individual understands subject matter or is able to apply a given skill Readiness is the ability to apply the total set of competencies required to perform a job task in a environment with acceptable proficiency A readiness test assesses an individual ability to apply a group of technical and core competencies needed to perform and excel at a job task This report describes research into workforce readiness conducted by the Computer Security Incident Response Team CSIRT Development and Training team in the SEI CERT Division This report presents the Competency Lifecycle Roadmap CLR a conceptual framework for establishing and maintaining workforce readiness within an organization It also describes the readiness test development method which defines a structured systematic approach for constructing and piloting readiness tests Finally the report illustrates the initial application of the readiness test development method to the role of forensic a PDF of the report Patterns and Practices for Future ArchitecturesBy Eric Werner Scott McMillan Jonathan Chu Graph algorithms are widely used in Department of Defense DoD applications including intelligence analysis autonomous systems cyber intelligence and security and logistics optimization These analytics must execute at larger scales and higher rates to accommodate the growing velocity volume and variety of data sources The implementations of these algorithms that achieve the highest levels of performance are complex and intimately tied to the underlying architecture New and emerging computing architectures require new and different implementations of these graph algorithms yet it is increasingly expensive and difficult for developers to implement algorithms that fully leverage their capabilities This project investigates approaches that will make graph analytics on new and emerging architectures more accessible to users The project is researching the best practices patterns and abstractions that will enable the development of a software graph library that separates the concerns of expressing graph algorithms from the details of the underlying computing architectures The approach started with a fundamental graph analytics function the search BFS This technical note compares different BFS algorithms for central and graphics processing units examining the abstractions used and comparing the complexity of the implementations against the performance a PDF of the report Additional Resources For the latest SEI technical reports and notes please visit http Share About the Author Douglas Schmidt ContactView all blog posts View other
