Blog Nickolas Guertin This post is by Douglas Schmidt and William Scherlis DoD technologies have traditionally relied on systems that are now widely available to all nations and actors The DoD past practice of incorporating COTS technologies on a basis are insufficient to stay ahead of its adversaries and increase its pace of change for delivering innovation The DoD thus needs new acquisition

2018 The architecture of Department of Defenses DoD acquisition organizations is based on Read More Towards a New Model of Acquisition Architectures for the DoD Second in a Series March 11 2019 SEI Blog Nickolas Guertin This post was by Douglas Schmidt and William Scherlis It is widely recognized that the Department of Defense DoD needs to have a nimble response to nimble adversaries However the inflexibility of many DoD development and acquisition practices begets inflexible architectures that often slow progress and increase risk to operational forces This rejection of modern development methods actually increases program risk and extends development timelines effectively reducing the value of the DoD acquisition portfolio Read More Emerging Opportunities in Modularity and Open Systems Architectures First in a Series October 15 2018 SEI Blog Nickolas Guertin This post is by Douglas Schmidt and William Scherlis In its effort to increase the capability of the warfighter the

Specify Requirements for Behavior January 16 2012 SEI Blog Donald Firesmith In our work with acquisition programs we often observed a major problem requirements specifications that are incomplete with many functional requirements missing Whereas requirements specifications typically specify normal system behavior they are often woefully incomplete when it comes to behavior which deals with abnormal events and situations the system must detect and how the system must react when it detects that these events have occurred or situations exist Thus although requirements typically specify how Read
