Bianco B TA ENGR 40M An Intro to Making What is EE Is a class where students learn to make stuff Through the process of building you are introduced to the basic areas of EE Students build a useless box and learn about circuits feedback and programming hardware a light display for your desk and bike and learn about coding transforms and LEDs a solar charger and an EKG machine and learn about power noise feedback more circuits and safety And you get to keep the toys you build Prerequisite CS 106A Terms Aut Spr Sum Units UG Reqs GER Instructors Fritz A PI Horowitz PI Howe PI Akbar TA Botbol
