March 18 2019 SEI Blog Nanette Brown Shift left is a familiar exhortation to teams and organizations engaged in Agile and Lean software development It most commonly refers to incorporating test practices and an overall test sensibility early in the software development process although it may also be applied in a DevOps context to the need to pull forward operations practices Shift left sounds reasonably straightforward just take the tasks that are on the side of your timeline and pull them Read More The Modern Software Factory and Independent V V for Machine Learning Two Key Recommendations for Improving Software in Defense Systems February 25 2019 SEI Blog Paul Nielsen capabilities are essential for our nation defense systems I recently served on a Defense Science Board DSB Task Force whose purpose was to determine whether iterative development practices such as Agile are applicable to the development and sustainment of software for the Department of Defense DoD The resulting report Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems made seven recommendations on how to improve software acquisition in defense systems A key evaluation criterion in Read More Rapid Software Composition by Assessing Untrusted Components November 26 2018 SEI Blog Rick Kazman Today organizations build applications on top of existing platforms frameworks components and tools no one constructs software from scratch Hence today software development paradigm challenges developers to build trusted systems that include increasing numbers of largely untrusted components Bad decisions are easy to make and have significant consequences For example decisions based on outdated knowledge or documentation or skewed to one criterion such as performance may lead to substantial quality problems security risks and Read More Certifiable Distributed Runtime Assurance in Systems July 16 2018 SEI Blog Dionisio de Niz Runtime assurance RA has become a promising technique for ensuring the safe behavior of autonomous systems such as drones or vehicles whose behavior can not be fully determined at design time The Department of Defense DoD is increasingly focusing on the use of complex systems to address rising software complexity and the use of machine learning techniques In this environment assuring software correctness has become a major challenge especially in uncertain and contested environments Read More Infrastructure as Code Moving Beyond DevOps and Agile June 11 2018 SEI Blog John Klein Citing the need to provide a technical advantage to the warfighter the Department of Defense DoD has recently made the adoption of cloud computing technologies a priority Infrastructure as code IaC the process and technology of managing and provisioning computers and networks physical virtual through scripts is a key enabler for efficient migration of legacy systems to the cloud This blog post details research aimed at developing technology to help software sustainment organizations automatically Read More Bitcoin Blockchain Machine Learning and Ransomware The Top 10 Posts of 2017 January 8 2018 SEI Blog Douglas Schmidt Each year since the blog inception

lot of interest in potential applications across many industries I recently led a research team investigating whether the Department of Defense DoD could use Watson to improve software assurance and help acquisition professionals assemble and review relevant evidence from documents As this blog post describes our work examined whether typical developers could build an IBM Watson application to support an assurance review Read More Security Modeling Tools October 31 2016 SEI Blog Julien Delange Over the past six months we have developed new modeling tools that capture vulnerabilities and their propagation paths in an architecture Recent reports such as the remote attack surface analysis of automotive systems show that security is no longer only a matter of code and is tightly related to the software architecture These new tools are our contribution toward improving system and software analysis We hope they will move forward other work on security Read More Subscribe SEI Blog RSS
