care and biomedical research and people tend to be a little more relaxed during the application process Bhanja is planning to do just that If all goes according to plan I would be looking at admission for fall of 2020 I am really happy with my decision to wait until my senior year to apply to medical school because all of my work from undergrad will contribute to my application Bhanja said Also it
