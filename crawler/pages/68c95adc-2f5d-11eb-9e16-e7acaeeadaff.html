Comparative Political Theory CPT has emerged as one of the most important fields in political theory Scholars working on CPT generally agree that mainstream political theorizing which is dominated by modern Western way of thinking fails to recognize the unique contributions of intellectual traditions and is insufficient in coping with new and pressing issues in a globalized world To study political theory from a comparative perspective they argue is to learn from classics and thinkers and bring political experiences to the forefront of normativenpolitical reflections This course is an introduction to comparative political theory as a field and an exploration of several traditions and their perspectives on politics Instead of surveying the canons in each religion or civilization such as foundational texts in Buddhism Catholicism Confucianism Hinduism Islam and Judaism we will try to understand perspectives by examining key political issues in contemporary political theory and world politics including but not limited to human rights democracy political legitimacy law toleration and world order Attention is given to how thinkers conceive of modernity and the West and how
