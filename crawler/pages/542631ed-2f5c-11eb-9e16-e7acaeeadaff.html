President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 3 of 3 results for OIT 245 Optimization and Simulation Modeling printer friendly page OIT 245 Optimization and Simulation Modeling This course provides basic skills in quantitative modeling The objective is to familiarize students with the main steps in an analytical approach to business decision making constructing an abstract model for a relevant business problem formulating it in a spreadsheet environment such as Microsoft Excel and using the tools of optimization Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis to generate and interpret recommendations The class will be taught in a lab style with short exercises done in small teams focusing on a variety of applications drawn from online advertising healthcare finance supply chain management revenue and yield optimization Terms Aut Units 3 Instructors Saban PI Comello SI Autumn OIT 245 3 units Class 30804 Section 01 Grading GSB Letter Graded CAS

Simulation Modeling Advanced This course constitutes an advanced option in the menu of classes satisfying the Management Perspectives requirement in Optimization and Simulation Modeling OSM The course is a superset of OIT 245 and OIT 247 starting with a very fast paced overview of basic concepts and quickly diving into more advanced topics and software tools By the end of the course students should 1 leave with a good understanding of different types of optimization and simulation models and when they are useful 2 be able to solve models using software 3 when faced with a business problem be able to identify what type of optimization model is appropriate and how to set it up most efficiently 4 be able to understand and discuss model outputs in a critical fashion The class is taught in an

a variety of applications drawn from advertising healthcare finance supply chain management revenue management and pricing scheduling and risk management We will be using Python as the basic software complemented with suitable packages for formulating and solving optimization models the Gurobi software and for conducting Monte Carlo simulation Students should be comfortable using these software packages by the end of the class but no specific prior experience with these packages is necessary Some prior coding experience is helpful but is not a strict requirement for the course Terms Aut
