Please contact the professor directly to discuss the opportunity and register for the research section Gerrymandering Free and Fair Elections Congress and State Legislatures Contact Jonathan Cervas My research focuses on partisan gerrymandering and the manipulation of legislative districts I ll be working on several projects this fall and into the spring semester I m looking to work with individuals who have interests in gerrymandering free and fair elections congress and state legislatures I have given a name to a specific practice of fracturing counties among several districts called I intend to measure the frequency of fracking in the American states Basic statistical skills are necessary and I m especially interested in students who can program in R and those who have skills in GIS Geographical Information Systems mapping Not required but having some skills in this realm is useful This research may extend to additional questions about gerrymandering If you have skills in computer science and programming there are potentially interesting questions about computer simulations of legislative districts that relate to the above research project Programming skills in R or python are the most valuable for this type of project Effective Political Campaign Strategies Contact Jonathan Cervas I have a second research project that I will be focusing on this semester which is an experiment to test individuals ability to create effective political campaign strategies Recruited participants will play a short game where they allocate resources to different states They will be matched against an opponent and the person who allocates the most to a state wins that state The goal is to win enough states with enough Electors to win the election After collecting this data we will be using the data to describe the strategies employed by the participants No previous experience is required for this project but I ll be especially interested in students with knowledge of SQL database and other web design experience Russian Capabilities in Libya Contact Alma Keshavarz I am seeking research assistance for a project on Russian capabilities in Libya The first part of the project requires research on Russian militia groups in Libya RA s will have access to my TRAC Terrorism Research Analysis Consortium database but should have familiarity with other databases as well The second part of the project will require research for content analysis This includes newspaper reporting and primary sources on Russian involvement in Libya since 2015 Syllabus of Scholarship by Women in International Relations Contact Madison Schramm Work with Professor Schramm to refine and expand existing syllabus of scholarship https by women in International Relations This is part of a broader project with Schramm Anjali Dayal and Alexandra Stark to create accessible resources to diversify syllabi and curricula and excavate the work of scholars in the discipline The researcher will be responsible for reading and researching subfields in the discipline where women are particularly maintaining and updating the bibliography and assisting in the creation of an easily searchable Prerequisite Theories of International Relations The History and Experience of Banking Crises Contact Daniel Hansen Common stylized discussions about the onset of banking crises are largely built around a small subset of episodes and much historical work is heavily weighted on this subset of cases The majority of banking crises thus have little to no historical work explaining the experience of the crisis and the factors which either sparked its onset or exacerbated the costs of the crisis This project seeks to build a historical narrative regarding each banking crisis which existing scholars have identified with the ultimate goal of publishing an encyclopedic text covering each countries experience with banking crises Along the way we will evaluate and categorize crises according to how well they fit different typologies of crises in addition to more careful examination of often excluded features For instance we will also analyze the explicit role of central banks and how responsive they are the stance of monetary policy in these crises international financial factors and how various political institutions are related to the severity of each crisis No existing knowledge in this area or special skills are required Hubert Humphrey Goes to China A Counterfactual Analysis Contact Dani Nedal Conventional wisdom holds that rapprochement with the People Republic of China could only have taken place under Richard Nixon watch The combination of strategic vision political expediency and unshakeable reputation as a staunch anticommunist and inveterate cold warrior the argument goes allowed Nixon to skirt the strict Manichaean worldview that shaped American foreign policy and shielded him from political backlash for going soft on Communism This standard account has a major role in understandings of foreign policy the evolution of the Cold War and relations as well as theories of the domestic politics of foreign policy This project evaluates this narrative against the counterfactual scenario in which Hubert Humphrey narrowly wins the 1968 election It draws on extensive archival research into Humphrey presidential campaign and his career in the Senate as well his closest advisors and political allies We also examine the evolution of partisan elite positions on relations mass public opinion on foreign policy in the 1960s and the role of the Vietnam war in shaping the political landscape of foreign policy in the period Research assistant tasks will include 1 Collect historic public opinion polling data 1950s through 1970s on relations 2 help conduct sentiment analysis on a large dataset of Congressional Records Knowledge of STATA or SPSS and R or Python preferred Rebel Leaders Database Web Design Research Assistant Contact Daniel Silverman The Resistance Organization Leaders ROLE database is an ongoing effort at three universities to document the biographies experiences and backgrounds of over 500 rebel insurgent and terrorist leaders around the world We have completed a preliminary version of the database and are now looking to build a website to host the data online as we begin publishing and promoting our results We are looking for a research assistant who is interested in creating a website to host and use social science data Prior web design experience is a plus but it is not necessary We are planning to use Wix or a similar tool so you do not need to be a programmer The website will include the database profile pages on each of the 500 different leaders using background research already conducted on them and online visualization and analysis tools for users If you have interest in gaining web design experience this is an exciting project in which you will build a website for a major social science database that should be used significantly moving forward Public Opinion in WWII Germany Contact Daniel Silverman The Strategic Bombing Survey USSBS was a vast government effort in the waning days of WWII to understand the countries the and its allies were fighting against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan and the effect of actions toward them during the war To this end it included representative public opinion polls n of both the German and Japanese populations in asking them a wide range of questions about the war they had just survived and its aftermath I have photographed all of the original declassified data sheets and other files in the USSBS Germany survey from the National Archives in I now need research assistants to help me input the data as well as conduct preliminary analyses on it This is a unique and rich source of information from a key historical conflict that has never been digitized before so it should be exciting to be a part of Research assistants will gain experience understanding how to work with historical quantitative data in general and opinion data in particular It should be noted that a large part of this project is data entry though there are opportunities for data analysis in R as well Department of Modern Languages The Language Acquisition Processing and Pedagogy LAPP Lab carries out experimental research on a variety of issues pertaining to first and second language processes At LAPP Lab our unique interest is in understanding the mechanisms and architecture underlying language acquisition and processing and then applying
