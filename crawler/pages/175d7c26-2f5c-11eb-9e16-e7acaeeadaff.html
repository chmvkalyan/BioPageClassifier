Douglas Schmidt Android Big Data DevOps Secure Coding Software Architecture Testing In the first half of this year the SEI blog has experienced unprecedented growth with visitors in record numbers learning more about our work in big data secure coding for Android malware analysis Heartbleed and V Models for Testing In the first six months of 2014 through June 20 the SEI blog has logged visits which is nearly comparable with the entire 2013 yearly total of visits As we reach the point this blog posting takes a look back at our most popular areas of work at least according to you our readers and highlights our most popular blog posts for the first half of 2014 as well as links to additional related resources that readers might find of interest Big Data New data sources ranging from diverse business transactions to social media sensors and the Internet of Things are creating a digital tsunami of big data that must be captured processed integrated analyzed and archived Big data systems that store and analyze petabytes of data are becoming increasingly common in many application domains These systems represent major investments requiring considerable financial commitments and massive scale software and system deployments With analysts estimating data storage growth at 30 to 60 percent per year organizations must develop a strategy to address the challenge of managing projects that analyze exponentially growing data sets with predictable linear costs In a popular series on the SEI blog researcher Ian Gorton continues to describe the software engineering challenges of big data systems In the first post in the series Addressing the Software Engineering Challenges of Big Data Gorton describes a risk reduction approach called Lightweight Evaluation and Architecture Prototyping for Big Data that he developed with fellow researchers at the SEI The approach is based on principles drawn from proven architecture and technology analysis and evaluation techniques to help the Department of Defense DoD and other enterprises develop and evolve systems to manage big data In the second post in the series The Importance of Software Architecture in Big Data Systems Gorton explores how the nature of building highly scalable big data applications influences iterative and incremental design approaches In the third post in the series Four Principles of Engineering Scalable Big Data Software Systems Gorton describes principles that hold for any scalable big data system The fourth post in the series describes how to address one of these challenges namely you ca manage what you do monitor Readers interested in finding out more about Gorton research in big data can view the following additional resources Webinar Software Architecture for Big Data Systems Podcast An Approach to Managing the Software Engineering Challenges of Big Data Secure Coding for the Android Platform One of the most popular areas of research among SEI blog readers so far this year has been the series of posts highlighting our work on secure coding for the Android platform Android is an important area to focus on given its mobile device market dominance 82 percent of worldwide market share in the third quarter of 2013 the adoption of Android by the Department of Defense and the emergence of popular massive open online courses on Android programming and security Since its publication in late April the post Two Secure Coding Tools for Analyzing Android Apps by Will Klieber and Lori Flynn has been among the most popular on our site The post highlights a tool they developed DidFail that addresses a problem often seen in information flow analysis the leakage of sensitive information from a sensitive source to a restricted sink taint flow Previous static analyzers for Android taint flow did not combine precise analysis within components with analysis of communication between Android components intent flows CERT new tool analyzes taint flow for sets of Android apps not only single apps DidFail is available to the public as a free download Also available is a small test suite of apps that demonstrates the functionality that DidFail provides The second tool which was developed for a limited audience and is not yet publicly available addresses activity hijacking attacks which occur when a malicious app receives a message an intent that was intended for another app but not explicitly designated for it The post by Klieber and Flynn is the latest in a series detailing the CERT Secure Coding team work on techniques and tools for analyzing code for mobile computing platforms In April Flynn also authored a post Secure Coding for the Android Platform that highlights secure coding rules and guidelines specific to the use of Java in the Android platform Although the CERT Secure Coding has developed secure coding rules and guidelines for Java prior to 2013 the team had not developed a set of secure coding rules that were specific to Java application in the Android platform Flynn post discusses our initial set of Android rules and guidelines which include mapping our existing Java secure coding rules and guidelines to Android and creating new rules for Java secure coding Readers interested in finding out more about the CERT Secure Coding Team work in secure coding for the Android platform can view the following additional

guidance most recently The CERT C Secure Coding Standard Second Edition for developers and programmers through the development of coding standards by security researchers language experts and software developers using a community process In a post published in early May CERT Secure Coding technical manager Robert Seacord explored the importance of a and enforceable coding standard in helping programmers circumvent pitfalls and avoid vulnerabilities like Heartbleed Readers interested in finding out more about the CERT Secure Coding Team work on the C Coding Standard can view the following

in the Open SSL crytopgraphic software library enables attackers to steal information that under normal conditions is protected by the Secure Socket Layer Security encryption used to secure the Internet Heartbleed left many questions in its wake Would the vulnerability have been detected by static analysis tools If the vulnerability has been in the wild for two years why did it take so long to bring this to public knowledge now Who is ultimately responsible for code reviews and testing Is there anything we can do to work around Heartbleed to provide security for banking and email web browser applications In April 2014 researchers from the SEI and Codenomicon one of the cybersecurity organizations that discovered the Heartbleed vulnerability participated in a panel to discuss Heartbleed and strategies for preventing future vulnerabilities During the panel discussion researchers ran out of time to address all of the questions asked by the audience so they transcribed the questions and panel members wrote responses We published the questions and responses as a blog post that was among our most popular posts in the last six months Readers interested in finding out more about Heartbleed can view the CERT vulnerability note about the Heartbleed bug that records information about affected vendors as well as other useful information Automated Testing in Open Systems Architecture Initiatives In March we published our first SEI video blog with my post The Importance of Automated Testing in Open Systems Architecture Initiatives which was also well received by our readers In the post I described how the Navy is operationalizing Better Buying Power in the context of their Open Systems Architecture and Business Innovation initiatives Given the expense of our major defense acquisition programs coupled with budget limitations stemming from the fiscally constrained environment the United States Department of Defense DoD has made cost containment a top priority The Better Buying Power initiative is a concerted effort by the DoD to achieve greater efficiencies in the development sustainment and recompetition of major defense acquisition programs through cost control elimination of unproductive processes and bureaucracy and promotion of open competition In the post I also presented the results from a recent online war game that underscore the importance of automated testing in these initiatives to help avoid common traps and pitfalls of earlier cost containment measures The Massive Multiplayer Online Wargame Leveraging the Internet MMOWGLI platform used for this online war game was developed by the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey California This platform supports thousands of distributed players who work together in a manner to encourage innovative thinking generate problem solving ideas and plan actions that realize those ideas Given the current fiscal climate in the DoD it not surprising that many action plans in the second Business Innovation Initiative MMOWGLI war game dealt with strategies In the post I listed several actions plans followed by the goal of that action plan in italics that came out of the second Business Innovation Initiative MMOWGLI war game providing a bonus to Navy team members who save money on acquisition programs The goal is to incentivize program office teams to take both a and view toward efficient acquisitions by optimizing delivery of artifacts with accrued savings over the lifecycle rewarding a company for saving money on an acquisition contract top savers would be publicly recognized and rewarded The goal is to allow effective public image improvement for both government and industry partners of all sizes and types to receive tangible recognition of innovations increasing the incentive paid to a contractor if the actual cost of its delivered solution was less than the targeted cost The goal is to give industry a clear mechanism for reporting cost savings a clear way to calculate the reward for cost savings and a transparent method for inspecting actuals over time Readers interested in finding out more about other work in this field can view the

Acquisition Three Variations on the V Model of Testing Don Firesmith post Using V Models for Testing which was published in November remains one of the most popular posts on our site throughout the first half of this year It introduces three variants on the traditional V model of system or software development that make it more useful to testers quality engineers and other stakeholders interested in the use of testing as a verification and validation method The V model builds on the traditional waterfall model of system or software development by emphasizing verification and validation The V model takes the bottom half of the waterfall model and bends it upward into the form of a V so that the activities on the right verify or validate the work products of the activity on the left More specifically the left side of the V represents the analysis activities that decompose the users needs into small manageable pieces while the right side of the V shows the corresponding synthesis activities that aggregate and test these pieces into a system that meets the users needs The single V model modifies the nodes of the traditional V model to represent the executable work products to be tested rather than the activities used to produce them The double V model adds a second V to show the type of tests corresponding to each of these executable work products The triple V model adds a third V to illustrate the importance of verifying the tests to determine whether they contain defects that could stop or delay testing or lead to false positive or false negative test results In the model it is not required or even advisable to wait until the right side of the V to perform testing Unlike the traditional model where tests may be developed but not executed until the code exists the right side of the V with executable requirements and architecture models tests can now be executed on the left side of the Readers interested in finding out more about Firesmith work

Introduction to DevOps Aaron Cois kicked off a series exploring various facets of DevOps from an internal perspective and his own experiences as a software engineering team lead and through the lens of the impact of DevOps on the software community at large Here an excerpt from his initial post At Flickr the and website the live software platform is updated at least 10 times a day Flickr accomplishes this through an automated testing cycle that includes comprehensive unit testing and integration testing at all levels of the software stack in a realistic staging environment If the code passes it is then tagged released built and pushed into production This type of lean organization where software is delivered on a continuous basis is exactly what the agile founders envisioned when crafting their manifesto a nimble process for developing and deploying software into the hands of users while continuously integrating feedback and new requirements A key to Flickr prolific deployment is DevOps a software development concept that literally and figuratively blends development and operations staff and tools in response to the increasing need for interoperability Earlier this month Cois continued the series with the post A Generalized Model for Automated DevOps In that post Cois presents a generalized model for automated DevOps and describes the significant potential advantages for a modern software development team Readers interested in learning more about DevOps should listen to the following resource Podcast DevOps Transform Development and Operations for Fast Secure Deployments Malware Analysis Every day analysts at major companies and research organizations are inundated with new malware samples From Flame to strains figures indicate that the number of malware samples released each day continues to rise In 2011 malware authors unleashed approximately new strains per day according to figures reported by Eugene Kaspersky The following year McAfee reported that new strains of malware were unleashed each day An article published in the October 2013 issue of IEEE Spectrum updated that figure to approximately new malware strains Not enough manpower exists to manually address the sheer volume of new malware samples that arrive daily in analysts queues CERT researcher Jose Morales sought to develop an approach that would allow analysts to identify and focus first on the most destructive binary files In his blog post A New Approach to Prioritizing Malware Analysis Morales describes the results of research he conducted with fellow researchers at the SEI and CMU Robotics Institute highlighting an analysis that demonstrates the validity with 98 percent accuracy of an approach that helps analysts distinguish between the malicious and benign nature of a binary file This blog post is a follow up to his 2013 post Prioritizing Malware Analysis that describes the approach which is based on the file execution behavior Readers interested in learning more about prioritizing malware analysis should listen to the following resource Podcast Characterizing and Prioritizing Malicious Code Looking Ahead In the coming months we will be continuing our series on DevOps and are also creating posts that will explore metrics of code quality as well as contextual computing and many other topics Thank you for your support We publish a new post on the SEI
