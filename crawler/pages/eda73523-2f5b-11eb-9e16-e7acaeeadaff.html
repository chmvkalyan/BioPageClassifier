greatest passions Jahanian spoke about the people and the ideals that have set CMU apart from the very beginning from university founders Andrew Carnegie and Richard and Andrew Mellon to trailblazers Allen Newell Herbert Simon Alan Perlis and Raj Reddy At a time when computers were barely understood we were among the very first to recognize the power of computing and we made some big bets said Jahanian who noted CMU established its Computer Science Department in 1965 the first Robotics Institute in the in 1979 the Software Engineering Institute in 1984 and the world first School of Computer Science in 1988 He reflected on how closely the university has retained its connections to the early years by creating new fields of inquiry like machine learning transition design and the science of learning and by influencing society through new technologies like autonomous vehicles and additive manufacturing And we did all of this while also cleaning up at the Tonys the Emmys and the Putnam

model for the business school and took risks that transformed the university from a small regional institute into one of national prominence The time to be intentionally bold is once again upon us

Jahanian said CMU distinct expertise and leadership at the nexus of technology and society working across disciplines to create transformative technology that enhances lives and shapes modern culture is desperately needed amid the rapidly accelerating changes in the world He quoted CMU late Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon We are not observers of the future we are actors Our job is to design a sustainable and acceptable world and bring it about Simon said But with technology often comes unintended consequences which must be addressed That why Jahanian said CMU balances technical knowledge with measured wisdom At CMU scientists and engineers work together with the philosophers artists and economists who will shape what might be possible with the ethicists humanists and policy experts who will guide our path and with the behavioral scientists who will measure the impact of our work on humanity Jahanian said President Jahanian said reinforcing and advancing the university leadership at the nexus of technology and humanity is the next frontier for Carnegie Mellon He pledged to support this effort by investing in a diverse community of faculty and researchers by doubling down on external partnerships and by creating living laboratories around the world Jahanian said he was equally committed to CMU educational mission and that students will always be at the heart of his

personal for me Jahanian spoke about the university commitment to establish interdisciplinary groundbreaking programs to higher education with the interests of students and the needs of society in
