User Interface Software 2004 Advanced User Interface Software Fall 2004 This is the OLD version of the course please see the Spring 2009 version Number offered by the Human Computer Interaction Institute Time Tuesdays and Thursdays Room Wean 4601 12 University Units Available for CS and HCII PhD credit and MS credit for INI MSE and HCII Undergraduates require permission of the instructor Enrollment limited to 20 students Instructor Brad Myers Office Hall NSH 3517 Phone bam Office hours By appointment or just drop by and see if I in Secretary Sue NSH 3526A TA None Course Web Page You are looking at the course Web page The URL is http Here is the schedule of all lecture material readings homework and tests Schedule Homeworks Abstract This course will cover the research and implementation of user interface software The students will get a comprehensive understanding of all the approaches that have been investigated by researchers and commercial systems for user interface software This will be of value to people planning to be user interface researchers or implementers After a quick overview of the design of user interfaces we will concentrate on how to implement the chosen design Particular emphasis will be placed on user interface software tools such as windowing systems toolkits interface builders prototypers and advanced user interface development environments In particular the course will cover MS Windows MFC Macintosh Toolbox MacApp OpenDoc Motif Visual Basic Director HyperCard OLE Java Swing Java Beans and various research systems like Amulet InterViews and subArctic Lectures will discuss the fundamental principles behind all of these systems while showing the historical progression of the ideas from research prototypes to commercial systems Today research topics and open issues in user interface software will be emphasized throughout This is primarily a MS and PhD level course but some advanced undergrads may be admitted with permission of the instructor Students are expected to have taken or be taking other HCI courses Prerequisites are or equivalent and considerable programming experience Experience with programming software engineering is desirable Prior experience with user interface design is not required Homeworks will involve extensive programming in Java Why Study This Surveys show that over half of all programming time is spent on the user interface portion across a wide variety of application types and this percentage is increasing as requirements for more complex interfaces grows In addition the tools and methods available for building user interfaces continually change and improve Therefore it is vital for software engineers to be familiar with user interface design and user interface software Prerequisites and considerable programming experience Experience with programming software engineering is desirable Prior experience with user interface design is not required Required text None If you have no prior HCI course you SHOULD buy the Nielsen Usability Engineering book referenced as Nielsen Text in the schedule Readings Unfortunately there is no text that covers the bulk of the course so there will be extensive readings assigned as listed on the schedule In order to prioritize your work I have marked all readings as required or optional The tests will not include material from the optional group unless it was also covered in class but they are interesting important articles that a should be familiar with Grades Individual components of the grading will be weighted approximately as follows this is tentative and subject to change Assignment Percent of Final Grade Homework 1 10 Homework 2 18 Homework 3 18 Homework 4 18 Homework 5 18 Presentation 18 Handouts Extra copies of the readings homework assignments and other handouts will be available in the bins outside my office The lecture notes will be available on the web the day before the lecture linked from the schedule page and will not be handed out in class you can make a hardcopy if you want Attendance There will be material covered in class that is not available in the readings so attendance at all lectures is highly recommended Homework All homework must be typed No handwritten assignments please Missed Tests Make up tests will not ordinarily be given If you know you are going to have to miss a test for valid reasons discuss it with me and you can take the test early If you miss a test due to a medical emergency you must notify me or my secretary before the exam Incompletes It is the policy of this class not to give incompletes Note that the course load is designed to be relatively uniform during the term since there is no big project at the end Late Policy Homeworks are due in class on the assigned day After 5pm on that day one letter grade 10 points out of 100 will be deducted An additional full letter grade will be deducted for each class period late
