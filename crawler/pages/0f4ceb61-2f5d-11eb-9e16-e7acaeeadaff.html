President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 4 of 4 results for MATH 53 Ordinary Differential Equations with Linear Algebra printer friendly page EE 65 Modern Physics for Engineers This course introduces the core ideas of modern physics that enable applications ranging from solar energy and efficient lighting to the modern electronic and optical devices and nanotechnologies that sense process store communicate and display all our information Though the ideas have broad impact the course is widely accessible to engineering and science students with only basic linear algebra and calculus through simple ordinary differential equations as mathematics background Topics include the quantum mechanics of electrons and photons Schr√∂dinger equation atoms electrons energy levels and energy bands absorption and emission of photons quantum confinement in nanostructures the statistical mechanics of particles entropy the Boltzmann factor thermal distributions the thermodynamics of light thermal radiation limits to light concentration spontaneous and stimulated emission and the physics of information demon reversibility entropy and noise in
