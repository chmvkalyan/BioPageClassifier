Baker Hall noaht through Bio As a sociocultural anthropologist I study the different ways in which human societies meet their needs settle their disputes and make meaning of the world As a political ecologist I work to understand the nature of societies as well as the sociopolitical nature of ecosystems My research on environmental politics is not just about struggles over resources but also about encounters among different knowledge systems cosmologies and ways of being in the world I employ both ethnographic and historical methods to trace how these encounters unfold at the local level how they interact with global forces and how they reverberate outward My work asks for example whose beliefs and aspirations serve as the default for transnational conservation projects and how does this affect the communities whose lands are targeted for conservation How in turn do these the beings with whom they share the in and shape the practice of conservation My empirical research focuses primarily on the Philippines where I have conducted approximately three years of fieldwork since 2006 A project examines the micropolitics of indigeneity and environmental regulation on Palawan Island a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve undergoing rapid social and ecological change due to settler colonization agricultural intensification bureaucratization and capitalist expansion My writing highlights the creativity and endurance of Palawan s Indigenous communities as they navigate and intervene in these powerful forces of dispossession and change In 2016 I connected this work with the Creatures Collective an international collaboration of Indigenous and scholars artists and activists who have come together in an effort to contest the colonial amnesia of contemporary mass extinction narratives and to support the resurgence of collectives in response thereto More recently I have initiated a new collaborative study of how Manila s traffic crisis interacts with social inequality technocratic authority and political subjectivity By connecting urban political ecology environmental history and the anthropology of infrastructure this project aims to offer ethnographic insights into a problem that permeates all aspects of life in this This project is part of a larger effort to promote collaborative and methods in urban political ecology With funding from the Foundation Alex Nading Cornell University and I are preparing to host a workshop at CMU on Collaborative Ecologies Anthropologies of and for Survival in the Motivating all of these engagements is a commitment to collaboratively producing knowledge that is accountable to the concerns of structurally marginalized communities engaging with a wide range of scholars practitioners and activists and contributing to broader efforts on behalf of social environmental and ecological justice At CMU I offer courses and mentor student research on Political Ecology Environmental Justice Climate Change and Climate Justice Southeast Asia Indigenous Rights Globalization Social Movements Disasters and related topics Additional information on my research teaching and public engagement is available on my personal
