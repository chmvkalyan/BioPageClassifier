of AI and Machine Learning Recent advances in parameterizing these models using neural networks combined with progress in stochastic optimization methods have enabled scalable modeling of complex data including images text and speech In this course we will study the probabilistic foundations and learning algorithms for deep generative models including Variational Autoencoders VAE Generative Adversarial Networks GAN and flow models The course will also discuss application areas that have benefitted from deep generative models including computer vision speech and natural language processing and reinforcement learning Prerequisites Basic knowledge about machine learning from at least one of CS 221 228 229 or 230 Students will work with computational and mathematical models and should have a basic knowledge of probabilities and calculus Proficiency in some programming language preferably Python required Last offered Autumn 2019 CS 236G Generative Adversarial Networks Generative Adversarial Networks GANs have rapidly emerged as the technique in realistic image generation This course presents theoretical intuition and practical knowledge on GANs from their simplest to their forms Their benefits and applications span realistic image editing that is omnipresent in popular app filters enabling tumor classification under low data schemes in medicine and visualizing realistic scenarios of climate change destruction This course also examines key challenges of GANs today including reliable evaluation inherent biases and training stability After this course students should be familiar with GANs and the broader generative models and machine learning contexts in which these models are situated Prerequisites linear algebra statistics CS106B plus a AI course such as CS230 CS229 or CS129 or CS221 Terms Win Units 3 Instructors Zhou PI Winter CS 236G 3 units Class 33480 Section 01 Grading Letter or Credit Exception LEC Remote Synchronous Tue Thu PM PM at Remote with

focuses on improving the Fairness Accountability and Transparency FAccT of a model in addition to its performance Although FAccT will be difficult to achieve emerging technical approaches in this topic show promise in making better FAccT AI systems In this course we will study the rigorous computer science necessary foundations for FAccT deep learning and dive into the technical underpinnings of topics including fairness robustness interpretability accountability and privacy These topics reflect research in FAccT are socially important and they have strong industrial interest due to government and other policy regulation This course will focus on the algorithmic and statistical methods needed to approach FAccT AI from a deep learning perspective We will also discuss several application areas where we can apply these techniques P more Deep AI systems have demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities A growing field in deep learning research focuses on improving the
