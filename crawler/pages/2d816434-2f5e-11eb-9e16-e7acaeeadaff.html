Stanford CS 384 Seminar on Ethical and Social Issues in Natural Language Processing CS384 Home Schedule Logistics Final Project Piazza CS 384 Ethical and Social Issues in Natural Language Processing Stanford Spring 2020 Instructors Dan Jurafsky Peter Henderson TA Hang Jiang TA Welcome I very excited to welcome you to this new advanced NLP seminar We will cover issues in natural language processing related to ethical and social issues and the overall impact of these algorithms on people and society Topics include bias in NLP data and models privacy and computational profiling measuring civility and toxicity online computational propaganda manipulation and framing power and various applications to social good We drawn heavily on related classes like Yulia Tsvetkov and Alan Black Computational Ethics for NLP and Emily Bender Ethics in NLP This is a seminar so most weeks we be in breakout sessions discussing and then bringing our discussions back to the group This is our first time trying to run a seminar live on Zoom so you should expect some pedagogical experimentation And your ideas all appreciated Schedule Each week of this class focuses either on ways to avoid ethical or social problems in doing NLP research I call these Red Weeks NLP Should Do No Harm or on ways to apply NLP to help solve social or ethical problems I call these Blue weeks NLP Should Do Good The current list of papers is a superset from which we will be selecting the required papers each week the rest are useful for helping come up with project ideas or literature surveys Week Date
