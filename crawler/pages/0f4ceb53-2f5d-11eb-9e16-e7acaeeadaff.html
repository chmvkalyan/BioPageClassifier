President update please expect ongoing changes to the class schedule 1 3 of 3 results for CS205A printer friendly page CS 205L Continuous Mathematical Methods with an Emphasis on Machine Learning A survey of numerical approaches to the continuous mathematics used throughout computer science with an emphasis on machine and deep learning Although motivated from the standpoint of machine learning the course will focus on the underlying mathematical methods including computational linear algebra and optimization as well as special topics such as automatic differentiation via backward propagation momentum methods from ordinary differential equations CNNs RNNs etc Written homework assignments focus on various concepts additionally students choose either a final exam or a series of programming assignments geared towards neural network creation training and inference Replaces CS205A and satisfies all similar requirements Prerequisites Math 51 Math104 or MATH113 or equivalent or

technologies applied to four main areas of Computer Graphics rendering geometry animation and computational photography We will study a wide range of problems on content creation for images shapes and animations recently advanced by deep learning techniques For each problem we will understand its conventional solutions study the approaches and critically evaluate their results as well as the impacts to researchers and practitioners in Computer Graphics The topics include differentiable rendering BRDF estimation texture synthesis denoising procedural modeling mesh segmentation view prediction colorization style transfer sketch simplification character animation physics simulation and facial animation Through programming projects and homework students who successfully complete this course will be able to use neural rendering algorithms for image manipulation to apply neural procedural modeling for shape and scene synthesis to implement policy learning algorithms for creating character animation and to exploit methods for simulating physical phenomena Recommended Prerequisites CS248 CS231N CS229 CS205A Terms Aut Units 3 Instructors Liu PI Wu J PI Hua X TA Autumn
