with practice in areas that reach beyond public speaking In preparing for this event I developed a lot of skills from speechwriting to public presentations and even what to wear for a presentation Niu said Going forward I can use what I learned here for interviews business pitches and dissertations First place winner Dhingra a student in the School of Computer Science Language Technologies Institute is working on building artificial intelligence models that can read and understand natural language text In addition to wanting the audience to appreciate how complicated human languages are and how remarkable humans ability to read them is Dhingra wanted to make them laugh A joke about the presence of the words Nigerian prince in an email signaling that it could be a SPAM message got a giggle from the audience With stripped down presentations that only made use of a single slide Dhingra and the other presenters focused on connecting with the audience with either an interactive element or humor and presenting a basic summary of their work As researchers we get lost in the details but it good to step back and take a look at the bigger picture of how our work fits in the world Dhingra said Explaining to a lay audience can bring us back to the fundamental issues our research is trying to achieve and this competition helps us do that Related Content Doctoral Students To
