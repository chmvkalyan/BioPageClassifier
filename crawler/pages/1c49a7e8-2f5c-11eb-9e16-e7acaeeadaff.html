March 21 2011 SEI Blog William Casey Malware Malicious software known as malware is increasingly pervasive with a constant influx of new increasingly complex strains that wreak havoc by exploiting computers or personal and business information stored therein for malicious or criminal purposes Examples include code that is designed to pilfer personal and digital credentials plunder sensitive information from government or business enterprises or interrupt misdirect or render inoperable computer hardware and equipment This post describes our work to create a rapid search capability that allows analysts to quickly analyze a new piece of malware Through our work in cyber security we have amassed approximately 13 million pieces of malicious software for analysis in a large malware database called the Artifact Catalog This blog will explore our research efforts to use Suffix Trees ZDDs and Sparse Representation Modeling to better represent the corpus of malware for search and retrieval so it can be accessed more easily by analysts One recent addition to the database includes a grouping of pieces of code recovered from the malware a type of Trojan horse designed to steal banking information We are conducting a analysis to identify similarities but it a difficult and task that involves massive amounts of resources including examinations and assessments by analysts Ideally with each new piece of malware analysts would learn more about the data and interpret the software functionality via reverse engineering an analytic process that provides an understanding of how the code works logically and mechanically by interpreting coded functions Reverse engineering a single piece of software can take weeks Reverse engineering pieces of software is best suited for an analysis process that automates all repetitive tasks including the identification of similarities in the data This frees the human analyst to focus on interpretation decision making and communication of findings Ideally a single analyst can comprehend and track the activity of a malware author even when the number of pieces may be very large and obfuscation techniques are used While the design of any one piece of malware is often unknown we know that many pieces share functionality In fact a majority is derived from a limited number of sources for example in the case of the data set it appears that all pieces may be generated from a small number of builder programs In recent years malware analysis has focused on identifying the source of the data code zeroing in on the similarities within existing sources Along with fellow senior researchers Jeffrey Havrilla and Charles Hines I am interested in trying to create a rapid search capability that allows analysts to quickly compare a new piece of malware against the millions of entries in the Artifact Catalog database The goal of our research is to reduce the time needed to identify similar pieces and relevant findings down to minutes and we identified the following three techniques to help us achieve this goal Suffix Trees which compactly represent the data by collapsing recurring features found in the dataset This technique provides a map of the malware landscape and is a novel representation ZDDs which compactly represent a set of sets and support quick operations for set algebras We will develop an application of the ZDD to support the modeling of the software corpora as a set of distinct families Sparse Representation Modeling which is a model for data storage that exploits principle features of the data that can be informed by analyst findings and may support multiple and potentially competing speculations Although some of these techniques have been used in other domains such as bioinformatics and genomic research our project is the first to combine them to automate malware analysis As part of our research we are collaborating with Ravi Sachidanandam laboratory at Mt Sinai School of Medicine Sachidanandam and fellow researcher James Gurtowski have developed applications of suffix trees to organize deep sequencing datasets for research Their expertise with the use of suffix arrays has advanced the field of research and we hope to have similar results with malware analysis If successful when CERT malware analysts investigate malware they will be able to use this tool to winnow out code that has been already confirmed as malware and pinpoint blocks that are different and may require deeper analysis The end result is a more effective response including assigning a signature to a piece or family to mitigate it or prevent further deployment In recent years CERT has established a reputation of excellence in the field of malware analysis and the enhanced analysis would give us one more tool to help in investigations To send us feedback directly about this post or to obtain information on accessing the limited distribution reports listed below please email For more
