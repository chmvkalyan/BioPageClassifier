tests will involve project staff members to check if things make sense If it looks good we start working with volunteers 1 in the the CCRMA quot Pit quot will take about 30 mins and involve 30 trials There will be 6 conditions of masking sound crossed with 5 conditions of speech sounds The masker FM noise and the speech sounds will be presented as if the sources are outside the room We use the measured room model from Tokyo and the exterior sound source position hallway The quot as if quot impression will be created by convolving with the measured impulse br br Strategies to define

complete technical documentation of the masking noise generation It also contains the br br The conditions of the masking FM noise will be defined by the following criteria br 3 bands of FM noise will be used centered at 200 350 and 500 Hz br This bands are selected based on an analysis of speech voice in the Tokyo office The motivation behind this decision is to identify the relevant parameters in the leaking voice For example we know that the wall is filtering much of the high frequency components so that relevant in the selection of the main br The amplitude volume of each band will be fixed br The amplitude was tuned in order to psychoacoustically balance the level of the three noise bands that will be used This balance was done without br The amplitude of the modulation will be proportional to the modulation frequency br The motivation behind this choice is to minimize the annoyance effect When the modulation rate is low higher amplitudes are more noticed and br The relation between of modulation frequency of the 3 bands is then the main factor to define the conditions br For this experiment 3 modulation rates are selected 2 5 and 7 Hz The idea is to span some of the frequencies in the range of 2 to 7 Hz Basically all the combination of these 3 rates are used for each center frequency plus a case with no modulation at br br Findings on the Beta Test br br There is a low frequency of the voice that now is not beeing br We need to use a really long conversation that does never repeat during the br This corpus of conversations need to have quot stationary quot br

br Speech 5 numbers one two three four eight spoken by a male and a female of different accents Numbers were chosen so that they cover five vowels br Masker Genetic algorithm approach with human response We vary one parameter first and then find one or two quot sweet quot Fix the parameter to those found values and vary the next parameter Choose the best two repeat this process br Analysis Response rate response rate is low when speech is masked we expect Response time distribution more response time when speech is better masked we expect Both analyses can be done and We can also observe what kind of speech is better masked with a particular masking br br Implementation br Image Experiment Experiment 2 br br Verbal Instructions br This is a test where there are only 2 buttons are required spacebar and enter return You are going to have 2 test runs where you are going to be presented with speech When you hear any speech you are to press spacebar immediately after to signal us that you heared speech At the end of each cycle a purple bar will light up to let you know the cycle is ready You will then press enter return to begin the next cycle The first 2 trials are to get you used to pushing the buttons in response to speech data will be recorded at the beginning of the third trial testing if you heared speech br br Speech used in the experiment where voices by Jason and Hiroko with the intent of neutral stress on vowels The words chosen were one two three four eight which were convolved with impulse response from the tokyo conference room combined with recorded room br br Post Experiment Subject Interviews br Phase01 br This test had the most diversity in types of sounds Since some maskers were not effiient subjects learned about rhythem of speech presented Subjects clearly described how some sounds worked better in masking then others since they had an idea of how many sounds were coming at what rate for each masker Subjects enjoyed this test because differences in maskers were clear br Phase02 br Out of the bunch of 27 maskers we picked 2 candidates for our quot golden quot For this test we changed the amplitude of different center frequencies for these 2 maskers which gave very different sounds throughout the test Some subjects found that sounds were noticably much harsher and annoying to listen to then others Several subjects defined that for one masker it worked really well in masking and sounded like being on an airplane Subjects still enjoyed this test because differences in maskers were br Phase03 br At this point we chose 1 masker and used different frequencies of modulation Most subjects described the sound as droning meaning that it entranced or hypnotized them This had an effect on most subjects who described the latter half of the test more difficult for them to concentrate Some subjects claim to almost fall asleep making it difficult to give consistent answers As I administered the test I even noticed the sleepy feeling every single time so I started leaving the room during the test Subjects said that they could hear the female voice very clearly when they would click spacebar although they would miss more female speech overall For the male voice that would come through they would listen for the deep male voice that sounded like short spurts of quot wha quot and quot quot For the most part subjects were hitting spacebar when there was speech and not hitting spacebar when they did not hear it as expected from the subjects that I did observe br Phase04 br Most subjects described the sound as droning meaning that it entranced or hypnotized them as well This made sense since we kept the same basic sounds but would change the frequency modulation amplitude The main difference in this test as I would observe subjects is that they would push spacebar repeatedly when there would be no sound presented This seem to be due to the fact that the 4 speakers above playing the masking sound is uncorrelated and getting random interference patterns I assume that the sounds that were generated have a interference pattern that was comparable to the speech used ultimately confusing the listener This effect played a role on all subjects that I observed and I let them continue pushing spacebar throughout the test Some felt test was too long because they were falling br br Experiment 03 Efficiency br br Implementation br br I programmed up experiment 3 This uses the Santa Barbara corpus clips in a design that produces a percentage measure of masker effectiveness It for one masker the best one arrived at from experiment 2 at a fixed playback br br Jason has convolved the first SB dialog file so it plays from the quot quot br br The subject hears a 2 second clip which the app selects randomly from the convolved file br As it playing the app records the maximum RMS of the first channel of the clip br The subject responds with quot yes quot or quot no quot buttons according to whether they heard br The app records the response and the maximum RMS played and then loops playing the next randomly chosen 2 second br br This iterates a whole bunch of times over 5 minutes producing easily 50 trials per br The analysis plots the percentage of yes response RMS We should see a threshold RMS below which the clips were effectively masked br br For the final quot efficiency rating quot we go back into

In recent years the question of how we interact physically with electronic music technologies has fostered a growing new area of research that we call Physical Interaction Design for Music We emphasize research using DIY physical prototying with and open source tools to develop new ways of making and interacting with sound At the Maker Faire we will demonstrate the hardware prototyping kits and our customized open source Linux software distribution that we use to develop new sonic interactions as well as some exciting projects that have been developed using these tools Below you will find photos and descriptions of the tools and projects we will br br br Planet CCRMA at Home is a collection of open source programs that you can add to a computer running Fedora Linux to transform it into an workstation with a kernel current audio drivers and a nice set of music midi audio and video applications with an emphasis on performance It replicates most of the Linux environment we have been using for years here at CCRMA for our daily work in audio and computer music production and research Planet CCRMA is easy to install and maintain and can be upgraded from our

Sequencer br br br br Image br br Pd Jack and Jaaa audio tools br br br In our http courses we use a prototyping kit based on Atmel AVR microcontrollers with Pascal Stang http avrminiv40 AVRmini at the core To the AVRmini we attach an I2C LCD display solderless breadboard strips a loudspeaker and sometimes a MIDI jack In student lab exercises and for prototyping we hook up sensor circuits on the breadboard and send control signals to a Linux PC over USB serial MIDI or Ethernet in order to control open source sound synthesis and processing software These prototypes are then often built into music and interactive sound art projects like the ones below that we will demonstrate at the Maker br br Image br br br Most commercial electronic instruments limit the control of sound to controls such as knobs or faders whose settings are mapped through various levels of abstraction to create a resulting waveform or timbre The WaveSaw is inspired by a desire to control sound in a direct and physical way We want to touch a sound to manipulate it with our hands as if it is a physical object The WaveSaw is an instrument whose physical shape is mapped directly to the shape of a waveform or spectrum and by changing the shape of the instrument we change the br br Image br br The WaveSaw is made of a long flat strip of flexible metal with wooden handles on each end with which the user can bend twist and rotate the instrument The shape of the blade is measured by flex sensors along its length The flex sensor values are sent via a microcontroller to a computer where a custom Puredata Pd object recreates the lengthwise shape of the saw blade as a table This table is then used as the basis of either scanned synthesis or spectral filtering In the case of scanned synthesis the table is used as a wavetable that is scanned at audio rates to generate a pitched tone whose waveform and hence spectrum varies with the shape of the saw blade Similarly the table can be used as the spectral shape of a filter through which any signal can be passed Additionally the WaveSaw has flex sensors oriented on the saw that are used to measure the amount of twist applied to the blade an accelerometer for sensing orientation in space and a pressure sensitive resistor on one handle to measure how hard the handle is br br br br Myrtle is a music controller that communicates with a computer via OSC Open Sound Control an machine communication protocol and MIDI simultaneously The interface is primarily designed for controlling the pitch amplitude envelope and rhythm of three sound sources in Designed in conjunction with the Pd environment Myrtle currently controls a bank of FM synthesizers via OSC and can transmit 12 different user selectable MIDI notes via a standard MIDI out port These notes are triggered using a fader br br Image br br Myrtle was designed to be used in a environment played solo or as part of an ensemble Instead of an quot quot design the functions of Myrtle are fairly specific giving it a unique sound and feel However since it is only a controller and not a instrument it can be mapped to any number of different sounds or devices limited only by the numerical data it puts out The typical usage of the controller is with the left hand controlling pitch via the foam strips see below and the right hand manipulating the various controls on the right side There are many ways to use the controller differently than this however The goal was to create a new and unique tool for musical expression and integrated into that goal was the idea that Myrtle would have the ability to control audio synthesis in complicated ways using an intuitive and design The combination of 3 different controls a fader optical sensors and a series of buttons used in conjunction with one another were all integral in achieving this br br Image br br Please see the detailed Myrtle project page here http http br br Image br br of br The Trees of Pythagoras is an acoustic instrument with the important distinction of being a single instrument composed of three physically separate parts Each piece is in essence constructed like a square member of the violin family Each piece consists of a large soundbox connected to a long steel string about ten feet long Each piece sounds acoustically with a wide dynamic range but only one unit is intended to be played by a musician The other two pieces are actuated using electromagnets which are controlled through a patch Additionally all three pieces have transducers which feeds the sound of each unit back to the computer The Trees of Pythagoras is a concert instrument intended for live br br Image br br The three soundboxes are all similar in construction to a member of the violin family They are constructed using a variety of plywoods eliminating differences in wood stiffness due to grain direction thus allowing for the square shape Different thicknesses and sometimes different cuts of plywood are used for the top and back plates allowing for two different sets of plate resonances Each has an internal architecture with a soundpost and bass bar Each unit uses a standard contrabass bridge An important difference to the violin family is that the top and back plates of these soundboxes are considerably more flexible allowing for greater coupling with the internal air column resonance Steel signpost bar is employed as a suitable neck and standard 18 gauge steel wire from the local hardware store is used as a string The string is freestanding not unlike an Erhu and connects to the steel bar at the bottom lays over the bridge and is attached at the top of the unit to a tuning peg inserted directly into the steel br br Image br br Two of the three units are actuated using an electromagnet assembly This assembly is then powered using a standard audio amplifier I acquired fairly powerful electromagnets which have resistances of around 4 ohms at 0 Hz like many small speakers For this instrument the priority was force I needed to be able to create large waves on the steel strings at a respectable amplitude Because I am interested in complex sounds issues concerning distortion are not important After much research and experimentation I created an assembly using two electromagnets facing each other on either side of the steel string Using ideas developed by Edgar Berdahl and Steven Backer see br http http I added two magnets on either side of each electromagnet which intensifies the magnetic field A stereo br audio amplifier is then used to feed the same signal to both electromagnets with the polarity reversed for one so that while one magnet is pushing the other is pulling This design provides ample force while still being powered by a small wattage amplifier With too much power the electromagnets will overheat To provide additional assistance with this each br electromagnet is attached to a heat sink For all three units I constructed a basic transducer using piezo discs and an based impedance buffer as a br br Image br br br br The Accordiatron is a new MIDI controller for performance based on the paradigm of a conventional squeeze box or concertina It translates the gestures of a performer to the standard communication protocol of MIDI allowing for flexible mappings of performance data to sonic parameters When used in conjunction with a signal processing environment the Accordiatron becomes an expressive versatile musical instrument A combination of sensory outputs providing both discrete and continuous data gives the subtle expressiveness and control necessary for interactive br br Image br br The Accordiatron detects the rotation and distance between the hands the latter by means of a potentiometer embedded in the scissor linkage that connects the two end panels Buttons on either end panel can be used for triggering notes samples or any other discrete input The Accordiatron is based on the premise building a new interface to capture what are known to be expressive performance gestures but divorcing those gestures from a particular sound source The Accordiatron is gathering a growing repertoire of compositions using a

to the shore br On July 14th 2006 a coastal power station in Jiyeh was attacked in an Israeli air strike br causing over tons of oil to spill into the Mediterranean Sea Although there has br been relatively little information regarding the ecological impact of this massive spill a br series of sattelite photos show the dispersion pattern of the oil These patterns appear br as ornaments that distort the contour of the Lebanese coast line br br I was in Jerusalem in July 2006 and read a fleeting and innocuous news report regarding br an oil spill on the Lebanese coast apparently caused by an air or ship based missile br attack on an aging power plant in Jiyeh Little information was forthcoming although the br estimates of the amount of oil spilled were alarming br In September I asked Jeff Koseff if he had any information about the spill He replied br that to his knowledge there were only sattelite photographs and that those were yet to br be carefully analyzed Tonight work the
