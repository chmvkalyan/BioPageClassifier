B TA Instructors Kovacs PI Esposito B TA EE 122B Introduction to Biomedical Electronics EE122B is a laboratory course covering the design and realization of key components and architectures of modern biomedical electronics systems their application in clinical and research measurements and practical matters in their safe reduction to practice Material in each topic area begins with an overview of the underlying physiology Details are presented beginning with the molecular cellular origins of the biosignals followed by the relevant transduction principles nature of the signals amplitude frequency spectrum etc and their processing and clinical use Specific engineering topics include safety in biomedical instruments fundamentals of conversion and filtering techniques for biosignals typical transducers biopotential electrochemical temperature pressure acoustic movement applications cardiovascular medicine neurology pulmonology etc and interfacing circuits Prerequisite EE122A or equivalent design experience and solid working knowledge of EE122A topics see course description Last offered Spring 2016 UG Reqs EE 155 Green Electronics EE 255 Many green technologies including hybrid cars photovoltaic energy systems efficient power supplies and control systems have at their heart intelligent electronics This course examines this technology and uses examples to teach the engineering principles of modeling optimization analysis simulation and design Topics include power converter topologies periodic analysis control motors and drives systems and design of magnetic
