types of interfaces and factors that triggered these paradigm shifts My current research focuses on building interactive systems that help people explore structure and make sense of online information in complex scenarios Short bio of Nathan Hahn Nathan is a current PhD student in the HCII also advised by Niki Kittur His current research revolves around building tools and interface to help individuals manage large collections of web information when they are learning about new topics leveraging computational techniques to support them along the way In the past decade he built UIs in everything from jQuery to Java to React to iOS and will be focusing on how modern toolkits build upon past lessons to provide a better development experience 26 Mon 2020 Tools for Creating

CMU I lead the Smash Lab Smart Sensing for Humans Lab at CMU Our group focuses on designing implementing and testing new sensing systems for immediate problems in various domains including health sensing technologies for developing world activity recognition and novel interactions Many times solutions in these domains need to be used and evaluated by the end user in their daily lives Therefore we collaborate closely with medical professionals and designers to develop solutions that can be immediately used and evaluated outside the lab environment We often rely on adding new capabilities to existing sensors and devices This approach allows us to add various functionalities to our devices without making any hardware modifications This work requires expertise in mobile computing sensing
