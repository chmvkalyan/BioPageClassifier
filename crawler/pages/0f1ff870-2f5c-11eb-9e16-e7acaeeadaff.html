Backing From the Cliff Edge Minimizing Risk With DevOps April 11 2016 Blog Aaron Volkmann DevOps practices can increase the validity of software tests and decrease risk in deploying software changes to production environments Anytime a software change is deployed to production there is a risk that the change will break and lead to a service outage This risk is minimized through rigorous testing of the software in a separate test environment where the change can be safely vetted without affecting normal business operations Problems can arise however when these Read More Integrating Your Development and Application Security Pipelines Through DevOps October 16 2015 Blog Aaron Volkmann By Aaron Volkmann Senior Research Engineer CERT Division The DevOps philosophy prescribes an increase in communication and collaboration between software development and operations teams to realize better outcomes in software development and delivery endeavors In addition to bringing development and operations closer together information security teams should be similarly integrated into teams An automated way of performing complete software security assessments during continuous integration CI
