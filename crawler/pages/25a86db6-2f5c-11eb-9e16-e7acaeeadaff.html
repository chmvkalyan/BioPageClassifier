Probabilistic Suggesting Pattern Colorizations Using Factor Graphs Probabilistic Suggesting Pattern Colorizations Using Factor Graphs Sharon Lin Daniel Ritchie Matthew Fisher Pat Hanrahan Stanford University ACM Transactions on Graphics Proc SIGGRAPH 2013 Abstract We present a probabilistic factor graph model for automatically coloring 2D patterns The model is trained on example patterns to statistically capture their stylistic properties It incorporates terms for enforcing both color compatibility and spatial arrangements of colors that are consistent with the training examples Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo the model can be sampled to generate a diverse set of new colorings for a target pattern This general probabilistic framework allows users to guide the generated suggestions via conditional inference or additional soft constraints We demonstrate results on a variety of coloring tasks and we evaluate the model through a perceptual study in which participants judged sampled colorings to be significantly preferable to other automatic baselines Extras Paper PDF Supplemental Materials ZIP SIGGRAPH presentation slides PPTX BibTeX citation inproceedings author Sharon Lin and Daniel Ritchie and Matthew Fisher and Pat Hanrahan title Probabilistic Suggesting Pattern Colorizations Using Factor Graphs booktitle ACM SIGGRAPH 2013 papers series SIGGRAPH year 2013
