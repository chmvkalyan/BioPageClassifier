Authoring Interactive Behaviors Authoring Interactive Behaviors Keynote address at the ACM Multimedia 97 Conference by Brad Myers Human Computer Interaction Institute School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University 5000 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh PA USA FAX http The new research described in this talk comes out of my Demonstrational Interfaces and Natural Programming projects A complete paper about this topic was prepared for The Ninth Annual NEC Research Symposium Human Centric Multimedia Community Nara Japan 1 1998 That paper is available in postscript or Adobe Acrobat pdf formats Abstract of Talk The tools for authoring multimedia presentations start with sophisticated interactive tools like Director and ToolBook However to make the presentations truly interactive requires programming in scripting languages These languages have generally been difficult to learn for This talk discusses the state of the art in multimedia authoring Next I will present a variety of ways we are studying to make authoring of these interactive behaviors more accessible to One approach is demonstrational techniques where the author shows the system what the behavior should be We are also investigating new languages which are designed to be more natural because they are based on how actually think about these tasks References For Talk Most of the statistics came from my Computer Almanac page http Phantasmagoria game by Sierra http Interactive Media Company CMU Chemistry Course Introduction to Modern Chemistry by Paul Karol at Carnegie Mellon University http Educational reference Hardaway and Will Digital Multimedia Offers Key to Educational Reform Communications of the ACM April 1997 pp Sega Sonic the Hedgehog http Small game created for Art History class at CMU http Quote from Michael Schrage MIT Media Lab Denise Caruso Technology Digital Commerce The interactive media industry begins to deconstruct its myths New York Times D7 Star Trek Voyager episode Scenario Originally aired May 14 1997 Microsoft FrontPage http SilverScan scanner from La Cie http Kodak DC20 digital camera http Hitachi MPEG Digital video camera http Just Grandma and Me by Mercer Mayer by Living Books A Random House Broderbund Company MacroMedia Director http GLPro scripting language by http Motivate by The Motion Factory for creating animated characters http Click and Create Version 1 used to be available from Corel The current version is called Multimedia Fusion and is available from IMSI http Gentle Slope Systems Brad Myers David Canfield Smith and Bruce Horn Report of the Programming Working Group Languages for Developing User Interfaces Boston MA Jones and Bartlett pp Allen Newell quote Allen Newell and Stuart Card Prospects for Psychological Science in Interaction Interaction 1985 1 3 pp SILK James Landay and Brad Myers Sketching for the Early Stages of User Interface Design Human Factors in Computing Systems Proceedings Denver CO May pp The Visual Basic version is done and the students are in the process of building the Web version Release information is on the web page http GAMUT Richard McDaniel and Brad Myers Applications Using Only Demonstration 1998 ACM International Conference On Intelligent User Interfaces January 1998 San Francisco CA To appear http HANDS http Back to Brad Myers home page
