Raster Scanning Raster Scanning a new approach to image sonification sound visualization sound analysis and synthesis Introduction Examples Introduction Raster scanning is a technique for generating or recording a video image by means of a sweep tantamount to a data mapping scheme between one and two dimensional spaces While this geometric structure has been widely used on many data transmission and storage systems as well as most video displaying and capturing devices its application to audio related research or art is rare In this paper a data mapping mechanism of raster scanning is proposed as a framework for both image sonification and sound visualization This mechanism is simple and produces compelling results when used for sonifying image texture and visualizing sound timbre In addition to its potential as a cross modal representation its complementary and analogous property can be applied sequentially to create a chain of sonifications and visualizations using digital filters thus suggesting a useful creative method of audio processing Special attention is paid to the rastrogram raster visualization of sound as an intuitive visual interface to audio data In addition to being an efficient means of sound representation that provides meaningful display of significant auditory features the rastrogram is applied to the area of sound analysis by visualizing characteristics of loop filters used for a model Construction of new sound synthesis systems based on texture of the rastrogram is also discussed Introduction Examples Copyright 2006 Woon Seung Yeo all rights reserved woony AT ccrma DOT stanford DOT edu Last updated Sun 26 Mar 2006
