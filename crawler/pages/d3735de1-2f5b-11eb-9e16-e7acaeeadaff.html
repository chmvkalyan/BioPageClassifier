Language Acquisition Processing and Pedagogy Lab News Research People Publications Opportunities Language Acquisition Processing and Pedagogy Lab News Exciting updates on our incidental learning study with Holt Lab Follow LAPP Lab on Twitter LAPP Lab is now funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH and Language Learning A Journal of Research in Language Studies We are so grateful and excited to carry out this newly funded research LAPP Lab will be accepting new graduate students to begin in Fall 2021 Students interested in the areas of second language acquisition speech perception speech production and word learning are encouraged to apply through the Carnegie Mellon University Second Language Acquisition program The most important thing we look for in an applicant is curiosity We can teach programming vocabulary theory process statistics and all the other skills needed to obtain a Curiosity however can not be taught in a graduate program We especially encourage minorities and candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply Applications are due before December 1 2020 Research As long as people are talking the world is our We agree with this statement from Diana Boxer yet sometimes a real laboratory is needed to conduct IRB approved research To this end the Language Acquisition Processing and Pedagogy LAPP Lab at Carnegie Mellon University was created Our lab carries out experimental research on a variety of issues pertaining to first and second language processes At LAPP Lab our unique interest is in understanding the mechanisms and architecture underlying language acquisition and processing and then applying this knowledge to develop pedagogical innovations LAPP Lab is equipped with a recording booth an access to language corpora and computer workstations available for stimulus presentation editing synthesis response tracking and statistical analysis LAPP Lab members are proud aRtists LAPP Lab is a member of the Pittsburgh Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience PCAN network which links students and faculty with an interest in human auditory cognitive neuroscience To learn about our recently published studies click on any topic below For

Lori Holt explores an alternative to traditional explicit learning incidental learning In our approach a learner s attention is directed away from the speech categories by an engaging videogame task that does not involve overt category decisions or language learning per se Our preliminary findings suggest that incidental learning of speech categories supports a wide range of perception and production outcomes This work is funded by the NIH and Language Learning How does knowing a word like made affect learning new words like maid and raid This project in collaboration with Jiang Liu examines how known phonological characteristics of second language L2 words affects how new L2 words are learned Using Mandarin Chinese as our test language a language with a relatively high degree of homophony we demonstrate that adult classroom learners use previously learned homophones to bootstrap their learning of new words Can musical training improve classroom learning of tonal languages This project in collaboration with Evan Bradley explores whether structured musical training can be used to improve linguistic abilities for second language learners of Mandarin Chinese How do heritage bilinguals store information about words in two different languages This project in collaboration with Natasha Tokowicz examines bilingual lexical memory and access Theoretically a bilingual must store information in memory about how words sound phonology how they are written orthography and what they mean semantics Heritage language learners are unique in that they are often exposed to speech as children but do not necessarily reach an level of proficiency We demonstrate how exposure to a heritage language as a child affects how bilingual lexical information is stored and accessed How does talker variability affect the perception of native and speech This project in collaboration with Lee explores how native and learners recognize spoken words given low variability speech from a familiar speaker as well as high variability speech from up to 16 different talkers We show that greater talker variability results in greater processing in both native and listeners What is the time course of Mandarin noun classifier processing in first and second language listeners This project in collaboration with Hannah Rohde investigates the time course of and semantic cue integration in native Mandarin Chinese speakers How does lexical frequency affect phonetic memory This project in collaboration with Melinda Fricke Christina Bjorndahl and Jevon Heath explores how words are encoded in memory Specifically we examine how a word phonetic information is affected by how often that word is used in speech People Seth Wiener Principal Investigator Seth is originally from Indiana
