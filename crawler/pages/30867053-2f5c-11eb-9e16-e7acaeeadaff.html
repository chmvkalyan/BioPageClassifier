Stanford Holland is also an alumna of the university s Diversifying Academia Recruiting Excellence Doctoral Fellowship Program DARE which prepares students from diverse backgrounds to pursue and succeed in academic careers Looking back Holland said the most valuable part of the DARE program was the community of supportive open people who cared about her not just her career I recently read the book Every Other Thursday which is about a group of women scientists who met every two weeks for more than 25 years to support and encourage and guide each other said Holland who runs a lab that uses solid mechanics and computational approaches to address important questions about the brain The phrase that especially stuck out for me in the book was cooperative action in a competitive world which is such a good description of Holland is one of 153 alumni of DARE which will celebrate its 10th anniversary at the email protected Homecoming Conference Celebration After 10 years of the program we re seeing the ripple effect of DARE Drell said of her chance encounter with Holland The fellows receive support to pursue academic careers while at the same time they enrich the educational experience of others at Stanford and at the end of the fellowship well beyond our Helping create the faculty of tomorrow Under DARE Stanford awards fellowships to doctoral candidates during the last two years of their degree programs The fellowships were designed for PhD students who want to investigate and prepare for academic careers and whose presence will help diversify the professoriate The program includes workshops field trips and seminars A new cohort of DARE Fellows Stanford recently celebrated the selection of 22 new DARE fellows the cohort at a welcome reception in the Black Community Services Center bringing the total number of current DARE Fellows on campus to 43 Like the cohorts that came before them this group is a community of individuals from a wide array of intellectual fields and personal backgrounds all with shared interests in authenticity service and doing meaningful work said Anika Green assistant vice provost for graduate education and director of DARE During the reception each of the fellows stepped up to the podium to deliver a elevator pitch describing their research and their hopes for the future to a rapt audience of faculty students staff families and friends All save one Dean Chahim a PhD candidate in anthropology who is spending autumn quarter in Mexico City finishing his field research for his dissertation about the history and contemporary practice of flood control engineering Instead Chahim introduced himself by video The goal I have coming out of this dissertation is to work as a faculty member and actually transform the way engineers think about technologies in relationship to social justice and also the way the public thinks about technologies and engineering as this magic bullet solution to all of our social and environmental ills he said Chahim said accomplishing those goals will require in part changing the academy That s part of why I m so excited being a DARE Fellow he said Not only am I getting the support to finish my degree and to learn how to become a faculty member but also to learn how to work for change within the academy I m looking forward to meeting all of you Alumni of DARE have found positions in academia industry and government across the United States from California to Massachusetts and in three other countries Click here for a map showing their current placements produced by the Office of

academic positions in institutions large and small public and private Patricia Gumport vice provost for graduate education and postdoctoral affairs said she hopes the success of the DARE program will inspire other universities to follow suit DARE has a bold vision and a decade of impact thus far in preparing our outstanding doctoral students for faculty careers and leadership roles at a range of colleges and universities said Gumport who is also a professor of education I hope DARE alumni will return to the Farm to enrich the educational experiences of our own students drawing on their impressive academic expertise They are compelling role models of the necessity of diversity and inclusion for the future vitality of higher Making a mark in academia Since earning doctorates on the Farm DARE alumni have been teaching setting up laboratories doing research writing journal articles and publishing books And in the case of Deji Akinwande traveling to Washington to accept a 2016 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers from President Barack Obama during a White House ceremony Akinwande an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Texas at Austin where he oversees a lab focused on translational nanotechnology reflected on his time as a DARE Fellow The important thing DARE gave me was wide insight into the life of a professor a life I could see myself becoming part of and Former DARE Fellow Chelsey Simmons is now an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Florida where she runs a lab that conducts research projects related to stem cell biology pancreatic cancer and tumor modeling Simmons said the relationships she formed through DARE helped her through the challenging transition from graduate student to faculty member There have been multiple occasions when I needed someone on the outside to give me a pep talk she said In the two years I spent with the DARE cohort I was surrounded by people who really made an effort to understand my personal and my professional Ali Valenzuela an assistant professor of politics at Princeton University and of the study Vote Switching in the 2016 Election How Racial and Immigration Attitudes Not Economics Explain Shifts in White Voting remembers giving a research presentation to his DARE cohort eight years ago I still remember one comment that I still pass on to graduate students even today You did a really good job defending your research without being defensive about it Valenzuela said The experience was especially helpful in preparing me for life as a professor because defend your work without being defensive is a mantra I try to live by every time I lecture or present my Among the DARE alums who chose to pursue careers in administration are two people who are championing Stanford s diversity efforts Marlette Jackson assistant director of diversity and inclusion in the School of Engineering and Chris Gonzalez Clarke
