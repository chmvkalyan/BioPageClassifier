Institute RTI to assess the cost to the economy of inadequate software testing infrastructure Inadequate testing is defined as failure to identify and remove software bugs in real time Over half of software bugs are currently not found until downstream in the development process leading to significant economic costs RTI identified a set of quality attributes and used them to construct metrics for estimating the cost of an inadequate testing infrastructure Two in depth case studies were conducted In the manufacturing sector transportation equipment industries were analyzed Data were collected from software developers and product data management vendors and from users primarily automotive and aerospace companies In the service sector financial services were analyzed with data collected again from software developers routers and switches financial electronic data interchange and clearinghouse and from users banks and credit unions the annual cost to these two major industry groups from inadequate software infrastructure is estimated to be billion Similarities across industries with respect to software development and use and in particular software testing labor costs allowed a projection of the cost to the entire economy Using the impacts for the two case studies an extrapolation to other manufacturing and service industries yields an approximate estimate of
