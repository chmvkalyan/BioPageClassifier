Research Institute for Software Research Executive Education Open Enrollment Training Course List Courses Our eLearning courses are designed as a virtual classroom where people can access our training from home work or anywhere Our training approach has been specifically designed to meet the need of working professionals based on a series of practical scenarios rather than the traditional lecture format offered in other institutions Our researchers have found that the most effective way to teach new skills is providing students the opportunity to work on projects where they can use those skills on a regular basis Students are given the tools necessary to implement change in their jobs immediately and call upon these tools for later use Advanced Big Data This course will teach you the advanced skills required to deploy and operate Big Data systems as well as conduct sophisticated machine learning based analysis This course will also provide a primer on machine learning principles while showing you how to deploy tools for applied machine learning that do not require extensive algorithmic implementation Most of the work in this course will be team based and task oriented Advanced Enterprise Architecture This course is the capstone of the EA certification curriculum It further extends the students understanding of how to apply EA theory and practice through the implementation of ongoing EA programs in public and private sector organizations An EA project is included as well as other examples of successful and EA programs Applied Data Analytics This course
