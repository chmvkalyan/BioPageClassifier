Presentation Benjamin Beckmann GE Global Research Amine Chigani Thomas Citriniti GE Global Research Joseph Salvo GE Global Research A presentation from the ninth annual SATURN conference held in Minneapolis MN April 29 May 3 2013 Publisher Software Engineering Institute Abstract Industrial systems and the internet have been increasing in complexity since the and are now at a turning point where a new revolution is evolving The convergence of the global industrial ecosystem advanced computing and manufacturing pervasive sensing and ubiquitous network connectivity has set the stage for an industrial internet revolution where complex complete systems CPS are coming online The deployment of these systems will infiltrate a broad spectrum of domains including energy generation and distribution health care transportation manufacturing and defense The industrial internet is posited to have a major impact on economic growth similar to that spurred by internet connectivity and computing investments in the second half of 1990s Additionally this new revolution will change the way CPS are managed monitored optimized maintained and inevitably decommissioned Consequently architecting CPS must address a myriad of architecture challenges related to complexity capability quality and technology We identify a critical set of these challenges Abstraction The scale of CPS and interdependency among its elements will mandate a greater emphasis on thinking about solution architectures that stakeholders of different organizations disciplines and expertise can use Architecting the software backbone of a network of CPS will require skills beyond those related to the software craft Standards Enabling communication and collaboration among a wider community of stakeholders will require standardization beyond the software architecture community Standardized architecture tools and nomenclature should include other engineering disciplines such as mechanical engineering physics natural sciences mathematics manufacturing and others Big Data The sheer number of machines expected to come online and the volume of data expected to be generated and transmitted through the industrial internet as a result will bring about big data challenges A major architecture challenge will be to decide what gets thrown away processed at the edge point of contact of the CPS with the physical world or transmitted and processed away from the point of generation the cyber world Cloud computing enables scale and essential elements of the expending and evolving nature of CPS Cloud computing offers an affordable efficient strategy to come aboard the industrial internet early to ensure a continued competitive edge However privacy issues related to export control intellectual property corporate identity governance ownership and others must be addressed Engineering engineering of products and services that form the components of CPS will no longer fit within an industrial environment Time to market cost complexity and competitiveness will require a much more robust engineering design methodology The potential to transform how engineering is conducted by adopting a collaborative approach to engineering and manufacturing is becoming a reality In light of these challenges we will discuss the impact on architecture practice in the age of the industrial internet and seek discussion about the way forward from the audience The industrial internet is posited to have a major impact on economic growth similar to that spurred by internet connectivity and
