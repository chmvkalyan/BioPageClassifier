Triage Analysis 28 Respond 40 Sustain Key areas covered under these major headings are as follows Protect Infrastructure Assist constituents with correcting problems identified by vulnerability scanning activities Implement changes to the computing infrastructure to stop or mitigate an ongoing incident to stop or mitigate the potential exploitation of a vulnerability or as a result of postmortem reviews or other process improvement mechanisms Provide constituents with guidance in best practices for protecting their systems and networks Detection Monitor networks and information systems for security Analyze the data or indicators from the networks and systems being monitored Enter reports received from the constituency into the incident management knowledgebase Collect incident data and intrusion artifacts malware logs to enable mitigation of incidents Perform initial forensically sound collection of images for forensic analysis and investigation Identify missing data or additional sources of information and artifacts Triage Analysis Categorize events using the organization standard category definitions Perform correlation analysis on event reports to determine if there is affinity between two or more events Prioritize events includes determining scope urgency and potential impact Assign events for further analysis response or Determine cause and symptoms of the incident Analyze intrusion artifacts and malware malware source code Trojan horse programs to understand their purpose to identify the specific vulnerability Peform vulnerability analysis Determine the risk threat level or business impact of a confirmed incident Respond Develop an incident response strategy and plan to limit incident effect and to repair incident damage Perform incident response tasks direct system remediation to support deployable incident response teams Determine the risk of continuing operations Change passwords Improve defenses Remove the cause

networks Run vulnerability scanning tools on incident management systems and networks Materials The content for the examination was determined using a panel of content experts consisting of CSIH professionals with expertise and experience who meet to discuss the eligibility requirements for the certification review the tasks in the functional areas of the analysis and develop a composite profile of a typical candidate From these profiles a list of behaviors is developed to distinguish a candidate who is minimally qualified from one who is below the certification standard The list of behaviors is used to develop a test specification that delineates the number of questions from each of the functional areas to be included on the exam Qualified subject matter experts were trained in techniques for developing clear questions to test the knowledge and skills required for minimum performance as a Computer Security Incident Handler Upon completion of the question writing process other subject matter experts were asked to review the questions for clarity correctness and appropriateness Questions were extensively critiqued rewritten if necessary and where appropriate rejected from inclusion in the question bank All of the questions in the question bank underwent the same rigorous review process by multiple reviewers SEI CERT provides training programs to support the needs of civilian military and contract personnel who handle information assurance for networks and systems Completion of one or more of these courses may help individuals to prepare for various
