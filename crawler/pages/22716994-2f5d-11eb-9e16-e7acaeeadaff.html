236 Recent breakthroughs in genomic and biomedical data are transforming biological sciences into big data disciplines In parallel progress in deep neural networks are revolutionizing fields such as image recognition natural language processing and more broadly AI This course explores the exciting intersection between these two advances The course will start with an introduction to deep learning and overview the relevant background in genomics and biotechnology focusing on the available data and their relevance It will then cover the ongoing developments in deep learning supervised unsupervised and generative models with the focus on the applications of these methods to biomedical data which are beginning to produced dramatic results In addition to predictive modeling the course emphasizes how to visualize and extract interpretable biological insights from such models Recent papers from the literature will be presented and discussed Stude more Recent breakthroughs in genomic

in deep learning research focuses on improving the Fairness Accountability and Transparency FAccT of a model in addition to its performance Although FAccT will be difficult to achieve emerging technical approaches in this topic show promise in making better FAccT AI systems In this course we will study the rigorous computer science necessary foundations for FAccT deep learning and dive into the technical underpinnings of topics including fairness robustness interpretability accountability and privacy These topics reflect research in FAccT are socially important and they have strong industrial interest due to government and other policy regulation This course will focus on the algorithmic and statistical methods needed to approach FAccT AI from a deep learning perspective We will also discuss several application areas where we can apply these techniques P more Deep AI systems have demonstrated remarkable learning capabilities A growing field in deep learning research focuses
