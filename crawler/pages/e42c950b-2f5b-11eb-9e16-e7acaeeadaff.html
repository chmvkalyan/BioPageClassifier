Counter Notification Letter Counter Notification Letter by Dave Touretzky dst One of the favorite tools of both cults and corporations seeking to take embarassing information off the Internet is to falsely claim violation of a copyright or trademark The Digital Millennium Copyright Act enacted in 1998 set out a notification procedure that can be used to request an ISP to remove allegedly infringing material from a web page However there is a defense against this attack called a counter notification letter Most people do know how to write such a letter which is why I put together this helpful form Dear Internet Service Provider This letter is written in response to your notification to me of a complaint received about my web page s The pages in question are insert list of URLs here My response to this complaint is as follows include all that apply from list below Allegations of Copyright Violation Digital Millennium Copyright Act The claims of copyright violation should be rejected because The material in question is not copyrighted or the copyright has expired It is therefore in the public domain and may be reproduced by anyone The complainant has provided no copyright registration information or other tangible evidence that the material in question is in fact copyrighted and I have a good faith belief that it is not The allegation of copyright violation is therefore in dispute and at present unsupported The complainant does not hold the copyright to the material in question is not the designated representative of the copyright holder and therefore lacks standing to assert that my use of the material is a violation of any of the owner rights My use of the material is legally protected because it falls within the fair use provision of the copyright regulations as defined in 17 USC 107 If the complainant disagrees that this is fair use they are free to take up the matter with me directly in the courts You the ISP are under no obligation to settle this dispute or to take any action to restrict my speech at the behest of this complainant Furthermore siding with the complainant in a manner that interferes with my lawful use of your facilities could constitute breach of contract on your part The complaint does not follow the prescribed form for notification of an alleged copyright violation as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 17 USC 512 c 3 Specifically the complainant has failed to Provide a complaint in written form 17 USC 512 c 3 A Include a physical or electronic signature of the complainant 17 USC 512 c 3 A i Identify the specific copyrighted work claimed to be infringed or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single complaint provide a representative list of such works 17 USC 512 c 3 A ii Provide the URLs for the specific files on my web site that are alleged to be infringing 17 USC 512 c 3 A iii Provide sufficient information to identify the complainant including full name mailing address telephone number and email address 17 USC 512 c 3 A iv Include a written statement that the complainant has a good faith belief that use of the disputed material is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law 17 USC 512 c 3 A v Include a written statement that the information in the notification is accurate and under penalty of perjury that the complainant is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed 17 USC 512 c 3 A vi This communication to you is a DMCA counter notification letter as defined in 17 USC 512 g 3 I declare under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief that the complaint of copyright violation is based on mistaken information misidentification of the material in question or deliberate misreading of the law My name address and telephone number are as follows address here I hereby consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which I reside or if my address is outside the United States any judicial district in which you the ISP may be found I agree to accept service of process from the complainant My actual or electronic signature follows electronic or actual signature here Having received this counter notification you are now obligated under 17 USC 512 g 2 B to advise the complainant of this notice and to restore the material in dispute or not take the material down in the first place unless the complainant files suit against me within 10 days Soon to come on this page Directions for responding to Trademark Infringement Lanham Act Violations Title 15 US Code Directions for responding to Allegations of Misappropriation of Trade Secrets This form letter is copyrighted by David Touretzky Permission is granted for unlimited use as a template by any private individual or charitable organization needing to send such a letter Dave Touretzky Last modified Thu Mar 21 EST 2002
