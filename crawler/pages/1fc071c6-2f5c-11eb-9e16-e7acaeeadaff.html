page See Canvas Discussions section Course Description This course is designed to provide new PhD candidates in Interaction HCI with an initial base of knowledge about technical research in the field Using a centered around readings and discussion it will consider a broad introduction to the research literature approaches and methods from the technical side of HCI Students should leave the course with an appreciation of how and why technical HCI work is typically done an ability to understand work presented in the technical HCI literature and a knowledge of past and current work across a range of different key topics within the field Readings This course is centered around readings from the research literature Many of these readings will be drawn from the ACM Digital Library https Material from the ACM digital library is available free when accessed from any computer on the CMU network To access the material free from other computers use the VPN service For VPN the instructions are at https There will be a number of required readings each week as shown in the schedule If you are knowledgeable about an area and want to recommend a different paper please let the professor know Discussions Each person in the class is expected to read all of the required readings for each class There are never more than 3 required readings so this should be tracktable There may be a about any of the required readings at the beginning of the class which will count as part of your grade Each person is also required to post discussion items to the class Canvas Discussions for at least two 2 articles for each class These discussion items can be an insight you found in the paper something you found particularly interesting or noteworthy a question you would like to discuss in class a point you disagree with or a constructive comment on someone else s posting These will typically be 5 to 10 lines up to a paragraph or two long and should provide evidence that you have read and understand the paper These are due before midnight on the day before class by on Monday for a Tuesday class This deadline is important because these comments help the discussion leader for each paper The optional articles are for your information if you are interested in the area and may be discussed in class by the professor or any interested students You are welcome to add discussion items to Canvas Discussions for the optional readings for extra credit but you still have to add items for the required readings Note that when you are a discussion leader you do not necessarily have to add to the discussion of the other two papers on the same day However you should still read the other 2 papers Leading the Discussion At least once you will be responsible for summarizing and presenting one of the required papers Each student must do at least one summary at some point during the term There are 26 students and 33 slots for papers to be reviewed so you might want to get your selection in right away Everyone wo fit in the last few weeks of the class A few people can do more than one for extra credit if you want Please sign up for the paper you want to cover in this GoogleDoc We will assign people by sorting all students into a random order in case there are conflicts It is not In preparing for your summary and presentation you should identify what you think is important about the paper Some questions you might want to answer in a summary include What is the goal of the paper Did the authors achieve it What was their method What are the flaws in the work What claim is made by the paper What is the appropriate way to evaluate that claim Have the authors achieved that evaluation What has the impact of the research been Who are the authors Have they done groundbreaking work in this area contributed incremental next steps or are they perhaps just starting out maybe they still students To answer these questions and others you need to understand the paper intellectual context This means looking up the authors and their work skimming some of the things it references and using a tool like Google Scholar to find out what has referenced it and possibly skimming some of those You will also need to understand how the paper relates to other readings from the class For each summary you are in charge of you will need to first provide a summary of the article to Canvas Discussions Each paper should already have an entry I created in Canvas Discussions and you can fill in your summary as the first reply and then the rest of the class will add their discussion items The deadline for adding your summary is before midnight two days before class That is posted by Sunday night for Tuesday s class by Tuesday night for Thursday s class Please be sure the summary is the first item for each article You should also monitor the students discussion and you should reply to people s comments on your summary if you think they are misunderstanding the paper or your summary Please do not add responses like Thanks You also need to prepare some slides to present in class The slides should be in PowerPoint or PDF format Please name your slide file with the lecture number the lastname of the first author of the article and then by followed by your name For example if I was doing it lecture You should also put your name and the full citation for the article on the first slide You need to email your slides to the professor at least 2 hours before class that is before on the day of your presentation so the slides can be posted for the class on the syllabus page If you modify your slides after that please send the updated version to the professor directly after class Your class presentation should be no longer than 7 minutes long and will be followed by minutes of discussion which you will lead in conjunction with the course instructor The students in the class will evaluate your presentation using this form Other Work in the Course In addition to summaries and discussion items you will be asked to perform a literature review on a topic proposed by you and approved by the instructor Additional details on the literature review are provided on another page Finally class participation will be a significant part of your final grade Late Policy Late policy for parts of the Literature Review 10 points off out of 100 per day That is on the first day it will be 10 points off on the second day it will be 20 points off etc That is for something due on a Tuesday at on Tuesday it will be 10 points off At on Wednesday it will be 20 points off etc This is a short course and the work keeps coming so do fall behind Course Materials The schedule and links to the papers are already available on the schedule page The course also has a Canvas site which will be used for uploading private homeworks and downloading information and for discussions of each article Attendance Because of the nature of the class the fact that this is a mini over only seven weeks with only 13 class meetings it is imperative that you attend every class In line with this a fairly strict attendance policy will be enforced which will be incorporated into your class participation grade Because many of you are beginning researchers we realize that you may have professional commitments such as attending a conference Consequently an absence for professional reasons approved in advance will be excused Absences due to legitimate illnesses will of course also be excused However beyond the first excused absence you may have to take an incomplete in the course with additional onerous assignments as makeup for the missed work Please discuss any planned absences with the instructor as soon as possible Note that in the case of an excused absence you are still expected to do the readings and to provide your two required comment postings by the normal deadline
