Million Cooperative Agreement Media Inquiries Matthew Nagel Marketing and Communications mnagel through Carnegie Mellon University and the Combat Capabilities Development Command Army Research Laboratory ARL the corporate laboratory that provides research for the Army announced the award of a new Cooperative Agreement totaling 72 million over 5 years Carnegie Mellon will lead a consortium of multiple universities that will work in collaboration with ARL to accelerate the research and development of Advanced Algorithms Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence A4I to enhance National Security and Defense For almost 30 years the Army Research Laboratory has been at the forefront of bold initiatives that foster greater collaboration with universities said CMU President Farnam Jahanian At this time of accelerating innovation Carnegie Mellon is eager to partner with ARL and with universities across the nation to leverage the power of artificial intelligence and better serve the Army mission in the 21st century Tackling difficult science and technology challenges is rarely done alone and there is no greater challenge facing the Army than Artificial Intelligence AI That why ARL is partnering with Carnegie Mellon University which will lead a consortium of universities to study AI according to Philip Perconti Director Army Research Laboratory The Army is looking forward to making great advances in AI research to ensure readiness today and to enhance the Army modernization priorities for the future The cooperative agreement is the contractual vehicle that supports fundamental publishable AI research which aims to collect synthesize and annotate massive amounts of sensor data and information to understand the contextual importance and enable strategic reasoning and insights to enable human augmentation by accelerating and optimizing and to deploy autonomous systems The research will also support the increased integration of autonomy and robotics as part of highly effective teams The Army currently produces and collects more information than it can ever meaningfully process relying solely on human analysts including video acoustics and massive data sets for a wide variety of missions health care maintenance logistics acquisition intelligence and operations This overwhelms traditional solutions for collecting processing exploiting and disseminating actionable intelligence in a timely manner This Cooperative Agreement for fundamental research was formed as a result of collaboration that initially started between the Army Research Laboratory and Carnegie Mellon under ARL Open Campus initiative which Carnegie Mellon joined earlier in 2018 Carnegie Mellon and the team of academic research institutions will focus on fundamental research to develop robust operational solutions to enable autonomous processing exploitation and dissemination of intelligence and other critical operational activities for the Army and the across the Department of Defense This Cooperative Agreement will also provide initial funding and support for the Army AI Taskforce since Army Futures Command decided to locate the AI Hub at Carnegie Mellon University as well About Carnegie Mellon UniversityCarnegie Mellon is a private internationally ranked research university with programs in areas ranging from science technology and business to public policy the humanities and the arts More than students in the university seven schools and colleges benefit from a small ratio and an education characterized by its focus on creating and implementing solutions for real problems interdisciplinary collaboration and the US Army Research LaboratoryThe US Army Research Laboratory ARL is an element of the Army Combat Capabilities Development Command CCDC As the Army corporate research laboratory ARL discovers innovates and transitions science and technology to ensure dominant strategic land power Through collaboration across the command core technical competencies CCDC leads in the discovery development and delivery of the capabilities required to make Soldiers more capable to win our Nation wars and come home safely CCDC is a major
