courses LINGUIST 1 Introduction to Linguistics This course is targeted to students with no linguistics background The course is designed to introduce and provide an overview of methods findings and problems in eight main areas of linguistics Phonetics Phonology Morphology Syntax Semantics Pragmatics Psycholinguistics and Sociolinguistics Through lectures activities and problem sets you will come away with an overview of various linguistic phenomena a sense of the diversity across languages skills of linguistic analysis an awareness of connections between these linguistics and applications of linguistics more broadly and a basis for understanding the systematic but complex nature of human language While much of the course uses English to illuminate various points you will be exposed to and learn to analyze languages other than English By the end of the course you should be able to explain similarities and differences of human languages use basic linguistic terminology appropriately apply the tools of linguistic analysis to problems and puzzles of linguistics understand the questions that drive much research in linguistics and explain how understanding linguistics is relevant for a variety of phenomena Terms Aut Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Podesva PI Sumner PI Brickhouse TA Grimberg TA Krejci B TA LINGUIST 106 Introduction to Speech Perception Basics of acoustic phonetics and audition What do listeners perceive when they perceive speech Examine current research including the categorical perception of speech speech perception infant speech perception Theoretical questions of interest to speech perception researchers and experimental methods used in the field Last offered Spring 2011 Units 4 LINGUIST 110 Introduction to Phonology Introduction to the sound systems of the world languages their similarities and differences Theories that account for the tacit generalizations that govern the sound patterns of languages Terms Aut Units 4 UG Reqs GER Instructors Anttila A PI Borgeson TA LINGUIST 121A The Syntax of English A introduction to the study of generative syntax through an investigation of the sentence structure of English Emphasis is on central aspects of English syntax but the principles of theory and analysis extend to the study of the syntax of other languages The course focuses on building up syntactic argumentation skills via the collective development of a partial formal theory of sentence structure which attempts to model native speaker knowledge Satisfies the WIM requirement for Linguistics and the requirement Prerequisites none can be taken before or after Linguistics 121B The discussion section is mandatory Terms Spr Units 4 UG Reqs Instructors Gribanov PI Petersen O Farrill TA LINGUIST 130A Introduction

issues in the linguistic study of word meaning We explore grammatical regularities in word meaning and the relation between word meaning and the conceptual realm The questions we address include the following How is the meaning of a word determined from its internal structure How can simple words have complex meanings What is a possible word How does a meaning determine the word syntactic distribution and what kind of reasoning does it support What kind of information belongs to the lexical entry of a word The course will show that the investigation of the linguistic and semantic structure of words draws on the full resources of linguistic theory and methodology Prerequisites Linguist 1 or equivalent or permission of the instructor Linguist 130A is not a prerequisite for this course Terms Spr Units UG Reqs GER Instructors Condoravdi PI Luo Y TA LINGUIST 145 Introduction to Psycholinguistics LINGUIST 245A PSYCH 140 How do people do things with language How do we go from perceiving the acoustic waves that reach our ears to understanding that someone just announced the winner of the presidential election How do we go from a thought to spelling that thought out in a sentence How do babies learn language from scratch This course is a practical introduction to psycholinguistics the study of how humans learn represent comprehend and produce language The course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of both the research methodologies used in psycholinguistic research and many of the findings in the field Topics covered will include visual and auditory recognition of words sentence comprehension reading discourse and inference sentence production language acquisition language in the brain and language disorders Students will conduct a small but original research project and gain experience with reporting and critiquing psycholinguistic research Terms Aut Units 4 Instructors Degen J PI Demszky TA Schuster TA LINGUIST 152 Sociolinguistics
