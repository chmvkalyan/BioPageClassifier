Software Structures for User Interfaces SSUI Fall 2020 SSUI Fall 2020 Overview Schedule Homeworks Software Structures for User Interfaces SSUI Fall 2020 Newly redesigned for Fall 2020 Credits 12 credits Time Tuesday Thursday Instructor Brad Myers Location Fully remote REO the course was formerly listed as hybrid IPR but it will actually be remote only TA Corey Emery webpage email Piazza We will be using Piazza for questions and answers especially about homeworks Web Site This is the class website http temporarily Permanent link http The schedule and readings and homeworks and policies are on different pages Description This course considers the basic and detailed concepts that go into building software to implement user interfaces UIs It considers factors of input output application interface and related infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them It considers how these aspects are organized and managed within a object oriented system We will cover the Tool and Skills for a variety of programming contexts including conventional graphical user interface GUI programming for mobile apps phones watches and other wearables web apps and regular desktop applications across a variety of programming languages and frameworks We will briefly touch on programming for and conversational AI user interfaces including speech and chat bots programming for visualizations games 3D and virtual and artificial reality VR and AR along with interactive UI tools such as GUI builders prototypers and resource editors The homeworks and project in this course will involve extensive programming in JavaScript so this course is only appropriate for students with a strong programming background Note that this is not an HCI Methods course we do not cover design or evaluation methods This course is designed for students in the SCS HCI undergrad Major but it also available to BHCI second majors or HCI minors Masters of HCI and METALS students or any undergrad or graduate students with an interest in the topic and solid prior programming experience who wish to understand the structures needed for professional development of interactive systems SSUI now covers different material than other HCII courses so you can take it even if you have taken PUI or DHCS The graduate and undergraduate numbers are for the same course with the same work Key Topics and homework in this course Using and designing User Interface UI Toolkits and Frameworks Input Output and Behaviors for User Interface Programming the Software Structures for Tools such as React Angular Android Apple Xcode Windows SDK Java Swing Flutter Unity D3 etc Please see the schedule for the complete list of topics and the homework descriptions which includes the policies for homeworks and the class Prerequisite Knowledge Students must be strong programmers For example having taken or or or or or or or or equivalent level courses will not be sufficient Familiarity with programming is strongly recommended Basic programming experience in Javascript is recommended since the homeworks will be in JavaScript Introductory courses or background in HCI is recommended but not required note that this is not an HCI methods course so students are expected to learn HCI methods elsewhere Fully Remote This course is expected to be taught entirely remotely through Zoom It will be possible to do all homeworks and any tests midterm and any quizzes remotely Class lectures will be recorded in case you are in a signifcantly different time zone but we are mainly planning for synchronous delivery Since all of the lectures will be recorded and available online for playback later it is possible to take this course even if you have another course that conflicts with the class time You have my permission to do this Course Relevance Most software developers will be involved in programming the of applications and there are standard software structures that pervade all of the tools that are used to support this Course Goals Students will learn the software structures that have stood the test of time and are the foundation of user interface frameworks and libraries for various platforms as well as newer structures for programming the user interfaces for AI game and systems Assessment Structure The course will have multiple programming assignments as the homeworks a final project and a midterm Homeworks will involve programming in JavaScript and later using the library Learning Resources Students will use a variety of learning resources including documentation for existing user interface frameworks and tools along with academic research articles which are all accessible free via University library resources Extra Time Commitments Assignments readings and the project for this course are done outside of class but should fit within typical expectations based on the number of units of credit Copyright 2020 Brad Myers Design by Michael Xieyang Liu
